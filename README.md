# the wiki is currently being reworked please wait democratically

This is the remake and the currently maintained version of the wiki. The old and archived version can be found [here](https://github.com/Costeer/101st-Wiki). This wiki is built using Quartz but heavily modifies the default layout.

#### How Do I Contribute to the Wiki?

First of all, you need to be an active member of the 505th.

If you are already a member, consult the Contributing page found in the wiki.

#### Edited in Obsidian

The content in the wiki (notes and stuff) is edited using [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/).

#### Built Using Quartz

Quartz is a set of tools that helps you publish your notes as a website for free. 
Quartz v4 features a from-the-ground rewrite focusing on end-user extensibility and ease of use.

This is what we use to make the .md (Markdown) files appear in the browser without having to code the logic ourselves.
