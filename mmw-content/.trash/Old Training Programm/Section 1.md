# Cadet Fundamentals
Welcome to the 101st!
1. Welcome to our Helldivers 2 MilSim Community, where the pursuit of fun and lore intertwines with the spread of democracy like fireworks on the Fourth of July! Here, we're not just gamers; we're freedom fighters in digital camouflage, battling tyranny one virtual battlefield at a time. By joining our unit you have become a cherished member of our liberty-loving brotherhood. From the depths of the Pacific to the peaks of the Himalayas, we spread the gospel of democracy to all corners of the gaming world. Our missions are as varied as the stars on Old Glory, from weekly deployments that'll have you feeling like a modern-day minuteman to covert recon ops that'll make you a virtual Paul Revere. But beware, comrades, for in the 101st Hell Battalion, activity and dedication are the holy grails of patriotism. Show us your unwavering commitment, and you'll ascend the ranks faster than a bald eagle soaring through the amber waves of grain! So strap on your boots, grab your controller, and prepare to unleash the sweet symphony of freedom upon the digital landscape. For in our pixelated paradise, nothing matters more than spreading democracy, one respawn at a time!

2. As proud members of the 101st “Hell” Battalion, your mission is clear: prioritize team unity and unwavering dedication to the cause of democracy above all else. When the battlefield beckons, cast aside personal ambitions and embrace the collective spirit of camaraderie. Follow orders with the fervor of true patriots, for in the crucible of deployment, it's not about individual glory but about standing as one against the forces of tyranny. So lock and load, soldiers, and march forward with the resolve of champions, for in our battalion, victory is not just a possibility; it's our destiny! 🦅🔥

3. No matter if you're a lowly private or a decorated captain in our glorious 101st “Hell” Battalion, one thing remains steadfast: you must follow our rules with the reverence of a pilgrim at the Liberty Bell and treat your comrades with the respect befitting heroes of democracy, regardless of their stripes or stars. Whether you're a rookie fresh from boot camp or a seasoned veteran with more medals than a Fourth of July parade, in our battalion, every patriot is equal in the eyes of High Command!

Code of Conduct

1. Uphold and salute your Commanding Officers with unwavering respect and obedience, for they are the mighty beacons guiding our glorious crusade. Follow the chain of command diligently, as a true patriot would.

2. Stay as active as a hypercharged Patriot Armor! If you're to embark on a covert mission away from the battlefield for an extended period, report your absence promptly. Remember, inactivity is akin to surrendering to the enemy and will result in assignment to the dreaded @deserter sector.

3. Let freedom reign, but keep it PG-13! No hint of nudity, lewdness, or anything that might make Uncle Sam blush. We're all about spreading democracy, not indecency. And remember, even your profile picture should be as pure as the stars and stripes.

4. No spamming like a malfunctioning Democracy Distributor! Use communication channels wisely and refrain from public disputes. If you've got a bone to pick, take it to the DMs, soldier.

5. Our battlefield is a bastion of respect and camaraderie, not a breeding ground for toxicity or hate speech. Any behavior unbecoming of a true patriot, from targeted harassment to spreading dissent, will be met with the full force of justice.

6. Impersonation is the highest form of treason! Don't even think about masquerading as another patriot, whether through words or profile pictures. Individuality is our greatest strength.

7. No hawking or haggling on our hallowed grounds! This is not a marketplace; it's a sanctuary for liberty. Cheating, hacking, or any other underhanded tactics will be met with swift justice.

8. Mutiny and dissent are the enemies of democracy! Any talk of revolt or undermining our Commanding Officers will be met with the most severe penalties, from demotion to expulsion from our ranks.

9. Time is precious, like the last charge of a Liberty Launcher. Don't waste the valuable time of our staff with frivolous inquiries. Consult our documents and basic-info before raising a flag of concern.

10. Loyalty is our currency! Patriots of the 101st shall not double-dip in other milsims or clans. Our allegiance lies solely with the cause of spreading democracy. Starsims and other games are exempt, for freedom knows no bounds.

11. Poaching is akin to betraying the very essence of democracy! Any attempt to lure away our fellow patriots will result in swift and decisive action, including expulsion from our ranks.

12. Alt accounts are as welcome as a communist in a fireworks factory! One patriot, one account. Let your actions be as transparent as the ideals we uphold.
