| Codename: CPT-08 “Gael”<br>Name:  ██████████<br>Rank: Captain<br>DOB: ██████ | “Ad Victoriam Pro Terra Aeterna”    <br>                   -CC-08 “Gael” |

**Duties:**
Captain of the Eurasian Company, he is a tough, but strong leader. Leading his many platoons to victory no matter the adversary, from the scorching temperatures of Hellmire, dense jungles of Malevelon creek, to the freezing temperatures of Marfark. He uses real-life tactics to strategize in tough situations, saving the lives of many, divers or civilians apart.



**Operational Conduct:**  
Gael is quite the team player when it comes to his fighting style, Most of the time running the team's designated Anti-Tank class. Using his trusty Recoilless rifle paired with many eagle strikes and orbitals. Due to his “high impact” playstyle, he prefers using heavy armor, starring the Kodiak and Winter Warrior Armors as his main gear.   


  
**Military Career:**  
 At the start, Gael was born into a loving and caring family on Super Earth. His Mother and Father named ███████ and ████████ w with two younger siblings, ██████████ and █████. Him being the oldest, he was destined to be the one who watched over the kids. His father, a high-ranking official of “Morgunson” Used his high clearance level to access weaponry that many civilians can not access. This gave the ability of Gael’s dad to provide firearms that most of the Helldiver Corps used frequently. Often bringing young gael to private shooting ranges stationed at where he worked, having one-to-one sessions teaching how to shoot. Of course, a kid with such expertise was out of the ordinary, he was enlisted as a sergeant in the SEAF and was stationed on many E-710 farms. Being able to eradicate dissidents so well he caught the attention of many, leading his quick enlistment to the Helldiver Corps. Gael was quite the unit, quickly stomping down and wiping our dissident cells for about 3 years. Once the terminid scourge started to become a major threat, he was recalled from his haven and put to the frontlines to deal with bug infestations. Gael as a Helldiver proved no issue for him, charging at the frontlines many bug planets, including the frigid planet of Estanu and and the smokey deserts of Erata Prime. He didn't go unnoticed, gaining many medals for his actions and leadership. Several privates have seen him “tear a bug in half while it was alive” by using the snowshoes on his armor to stomp hunters and scavengers.

**Recruitment to the 101st “Hell” Battalion:**  
After his many deployments, he eventually caught the attention of BM-01 “Mind”. Who at that time, was starting to develop the early roots of the 101st. Given his skills, Gael was quickly pulled into the battalion. Mind saw Gael fight the automaton menace aboard his Super Destroyer, using his eagle-eye to closely monitor the actions and decisions Gael takes. The automatons which wiped out many civilian settlements did not seem to have any mental toll on Gael, him simply being there to finish a job, which Mind liked a lot about him. Gael had a “no-bullshit” attitude dealing with the main objective, and some sides before leaving. Though Gael liked to work with the Helldiver corps, he never grew any real attachment to the group, and gladly joined the 101st when Mind approached him after they extracted.


**Trauma and PTSD:**
Gael has an interesting case for his trauma. Since he was the one who protected his younger siblings in school, he grew up in violence. His younger siblings would be frequently bullied, mostly due to their heritage. And often having young Gael knock them out on the sidewalk. His early exposure to violence and his early exposure to firearms from his father molded him into the captain he is today. His time fighting also contributed to his desensitization of trauma and PTSD. Frequent losses of poor divers and shellshock led him to simply not have any real feelings toward any morally debilitating losses on the battleground. Instead of grieving the loss of a subordinate, he would change that sorrow into anger, often being seen shooting the bodies of the automatons or ripping the terminid that killed a diver.


**Service in the 101st:**
Gael moved up the ranks with Steroid as well, being under command of Freeze and Mind. Gael worked quite well with Steroid, both having relatively similar interests and hatred, but still having wildly different experience working for the SEAF and early childhoods. They would spend most of their time going into deployments together as well as goofing around in the mess hall. His skills were unmatched in different ways, preferring to stick with the fireteam and not going solo like others. Having zero issue with ordering his subordinates around. Pushing the automaton front, and being able to use his sharp senses to hear and see patrols from extreme distances. From the thumps from hulks or the steady humms from a tank. He would be able to identify a threat when they are not even remotely near histeam. Many privates under his command have seen him look at the track of a bot patrol and accurately described each footprint, from the spacing and pattern of the track he was able to determine that there were 3 troopers, 4 devastators, 3 berserkers and 1 hulk. He has also been noted to blast off the face of a bile titan, just under 10 meters away from him, spraying the surrounding area and him with green goop from the blast of his trusty Recoilless Rifle. Gael quickly climbed the ranks, due to the massive vacancy currently available during the start of the battalion, he was raised from private to corporal quickly. Getting trained from Freeze and Mind, he rose to sergeant and quickly to the Captain. After being inactive for a bit, he was quickly put back into service and to this day, still the bold leader of the Gael/Eurasian Company.
