#### Duties:
Serves as Second in Command of Freeze company within the battalion, assisting captain Freeze in command responsibilities. He plays a pivotal role in strategic planning, logistical coordination, and decision-making. Additionally, he commands Steroid Platoon, leading his soldiers in front line engagements against humanity's enemies.

#### Operational Conduct:
Demonstrates exceptional battlefield awareness and strategic command, effectively preventing tunnel vision among squad members during critical engagements. His predominant use of a jetpack enhances maneuverability, allowing him to gain tactical advantages and execute high-impact strikes with his specialized "Bullfrog" demolition class. This approach focuses on neutralizing major threats and key enemy infrastructure using a combination of the quasar cannon, scorcher rifle, and eagle airstrikes, ensuring mission success and maximizing the combat effectiveness of his unit.

#### Military Career:
Military career began under extraordinary circumstances. As a child survivor of an Automaton invasion on his homeworld, he was rescued by a Helldiver corps during a planetary liberation campaign. Raised within the corps, he gained early exposure to military operations, supporting Helldivers on super destroyers and mastering their tactics. His unique upbringing and exceptional skills led to early induction into active duty, bypassing age regulations. Quickly ascending through the ranks due to his invaluable battlefield insights, Lieutenant Steroid caught the attention of the elite 101st "Hell" Battalion. Recognized for his potential to enhance the unit, he was recruited to lead a platoon, where he has since been instrumental in mentoring emerging heroes and bolstering the battalion’s strength and reputation.

### Addendum 1: 

**Operation Log of Helldiver squad Alpha Recon 6**  
— — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — Date: [REDACTED]  
Location: [REDACTED]  
Operation Code: Op-317X  
Squad Name: Alpha Recon 6  
Squad Leader: Sergeant Marcus ████

##### Objective:  
Conduct a search and rescue operation in response to an Automaton attack on civilian residences in sector 47-B.
##### Background:  
The region had recently suffered a devastating assault by Automaton forces, resulting in significant destruction of civilian infrastructure and numerous casualties. Intelligence reports indicated possible survivors trapped in the area, necessitating an immediate Helldiver intervention to locate and rescue any civilians and assess ongoing threats.

##### Log:

Deployment at dawn, with the team fully equipped for urban search and rescue under potentially hostile conditions.

Initial assessment revealed extensive damage; several residential blocks were demolished, with fires still burning in some areas.

At 0530 hrs, amidst the wreckage of what was once a housing complex, Corporal Jenkins detected a faint heat signature.

Investigation led to the discovery of a young boy beneath the rubble, identified as Jacob Jenssen. The child was in shock, showing signs of emotional distress and physical injuries.

Immediate first aid was administered, and the child was comforted by Specialist Tara Lee, who has training in psychology.

The team secured the perimeter, confirming no immediate Automaton threat in the vicinity.

Arrived at the designated safe zone at 0630 hrs, where the child was transferred to SEAF foot soldiers

##### Outcome:  
Mission successful with the rescue of one child survivor. The area was secured, and no Automaton threats were encountered during extraction. The survivor is under medical care and will receive ongoing psychological support due to potential trauma.

  

##### Leader’s Notes:  
The squad performed very well, exactly as trained. I can’t help but feel sorry for the young boy we rescued. He probably lost his entire family to these heartless monsters. The squad is worried that the boy might have nowhere to go.

  

**Addition 1:**

A few weeks after the deployment, the medical department contacted us and informed us that the boy had fully healed up but had nowhere to go. He would have to go into foster care on another Planet. After a long discussion with all of my squad members, we decided to adopt the boy and take him with us. He will be living on the super destroyer and we are currently waiting for him to be transferred.

  

**Addition 2:**

The boy has been on the ship for a few days now but has not spoken a single word with any of us, except for Tara. He opened up to her about what he saw that day and broke down right after. He wept uncontrollably for a few hours while the squad tried to comfort him by any means possible. He’s asleep now in a makeshift room we set up for him. I really hope he gets better with time.

  

**Addition 3:**

After a few sessions with his psychiatrist, the boy seems to be in a better mood now. He started helping around on the ship and has been talking to all of us. We are very relieved that he is doing better. He tried carrying an Autocannon the other day all by himself and promptly dropped it on the floor. Ryan started calling him “Steroid” after that and the name stuck with him. 

  

**Addition 4:**

Steroid talked to me and said that he wants to become a helldiver, like us. I tried to tell him otherwise but he insisted. He really wants to and brought it up multiple times to the entire squad. I have talked with my higher ups and managed to organize a personal trainer for him to surprise him with his first training session tomorrow. I do have a few concerns about him starting such intensive training at his young age, but the boy has already seen things nobody should ever see in their lives and as far as I’ve noticed, he seems very capable.

### Training Logs

**Phase 1: Personal Sessions**  
**Start Date**: [REDACTED]

  
Steroid began his training under my direct supervision aboard the SES ████████████. Early sessions focused on basic physical conditioning and combat readiness drills. Despite his young age, Steroid displayed remarkable determination and quickly mastered basic combat tactics and weaponry handling.

  

**Progress Assessment**: Steroids agility and quick learning ability allowed him to excel at his training, significantly improving his endurance and basic combat capabilities, allowing him to move on to helldiver bootcamp on Super Earth.

  

**Phase 2: Helldiver Bootcamp on Super Earth**  
**Start Date**: [REDACTED]

  
Steroid transitioned to the more structured environment of the Helldiver Bootcamp on Super Earth. The curriculum expanded to include advanced tactical training, Stratagem management, survival skills, and enhanced physical conditioning. His ability to adapt to diverse combat scenarios was notably impressive.

**Progress Assessment**: Demonstrated leadership in team operations and critical thinking in high-pressure simulations. Recommended for advanced training given his rapid acquisition of skills.

  

**Phase 3: Advanced Training Facility on Mars**  
**Start Date**: [REDACTED]

The current phase involves specialized training in extraterrestrial warfare tactics, including combat in different environments and advanced navigation techniques. Steroids performance remains exceptional, with notable achievements in environmental adaptation and combat resourcefulness. The negatives include a substantial increase in stress and also a small return of the trauma symptoms that were reported by  
Dr. Lisa Grant

  

**Progress Assessment**: Continues to show growth in strategic combat engagements and has been selected for early enlistment into the helldiver corps by the SEAF.

  

Recommendations for Further Development:

- Recruitment into an elite helldiver unit
- Increase in leadership responsibilities 
- Granting of a medical substance to decrease stress and to minimize the risk of the Trauma symptoms returning
