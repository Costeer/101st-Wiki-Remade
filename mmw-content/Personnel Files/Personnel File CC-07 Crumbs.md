| Codename: CPT-07 “Crumbs”<br>Name:  ████████████<br>Rank: Captain<br>DOB: ██████ | “You know Only thing I get when Super Earth offers <br>me extra juice for good work? It's always apple juice.”  <br>-CC-07 “Crumbs” |

Duties:

The bold leader of the Crumbs Company, being a stalwart for the frontlines in both fronts. Leading his many platoons of battle-hardened helldivers to victory. He is the battle-ram of the “Hell” Battalion, straightforward, logistical, and intellectually gifted at wartime strategies. He is a formidable foe for any adversary. 

  

Operational Conduct:  
Crumbs is quite the self-sufficient person when it comes to his strategies. Using the Jump Pack as well as the Flame Thrower to employ hit and run tactics on the bugs. He uses the Orbital Rail Cannon Strike as an anti-tank option and a machine gun sentry for horde clearance and a way to use it as a decoy to make a hasty escape. 

  

Military Career:

Before Crumbs was enlisted, he was a inhabitant of the most infamous planet of the Umlaut Sector, Meridia. Spending his early childhood in a E-710 farm, with both of his loving parents XXXXXXX and XXXXXXX. Being exposed to the terminids early on led to his expertise with the species. His life was relatively peaceful, though Around the age of XX  his parents started to have marriage issues, and ultimately ended up with him as an orphan. Without parents Crumbs did fine, making a best friend named XXXXXXX. In the orphanage he got exposed to lots of posters about the Helldivers corps, making him resilient to trauma. Once the terminids started to escape enclosure and attack the civilians, he and several other people got evacuated to high-priority citizen bunkers, but not at a loss. As he was evacuating, his best friend got slaughtered as a bane of terminid “Warriors” lunged at him and got torn into shreds. With the blood of his friend on him he managed to make it into the bunker. As he grew up, his hatred for terminids ended up with him being enlisted to the Helldiver corps. During that time, he helped the construction of the TCS towers to repel the terminid advance. As he fell from his hellpod, he saw the familiar place he once lived, as well as the skeleton of his old friend, still wearing the Super-Earth issued uniform, just with a plethora of cuts from the warrior. A piece of fabric pinned to his armor symbolizes his best friend, and uses it as a reminder to push on. He climbed the ranks quickly, being able to lead a squad into the terminid supercolony that is meridia and launched several attacks to deploy the dark fluid into the planet. Every time, gathering trophies of the bugs, ranging from a head of a hunter, a wing of a shrieker, or even a piece of armor from a fallen bile titan. As the planet reached its limit, He witnessed the planet implode on itself, just before FTL jumping, creating the wormhole that we know today. Multiple privates have noted that he would spend long periods of time, staring into the remnants of merida, while holding a small blue piece of fabric, saying “I did it XXXXXXX, I did it for you”.


Recruitment to the 101st “Hell” Battalion:  
Shortly after his operations on Angels Venture. Crumbs kept on losing squad after squad on Malevelon Creek and eventually running out of reinforcements, Crumbs decides to go solo, changing the pace for the mission throughout.By being solo, the automaton forces had a difficult time tracking his position, him often using single-hit stratagems to make his presence less bold. By using several stealth tactics and utilizing sentries as decoys, he was able to complete many objectives for the ICBM as stealthily as possible. The only time Crumbs had to stand his ground was during the long processes that involved raising the ICBM and fueling it with XXXXXXXX. This mission overall caused Crumbs to lose faith in the standard issue helldivers. This caught the attention of the person with the callsign “Steroid” promising “Greater opportunities” and “specialized divers”. 

  

Trauma and PTSD:

As mentioned before, Crumbs has a rare case of not appearing to have any forms of stress-disorders or any trauma. Super-Earth Doctors have examined his brain through multiple different scans. And have noticed severely less brain activity in the part where a person feels sorrow or regret, the activity being more active in parts where feelings of retribution, redemption, revenge, and vengeance. Scientists suggest the early exposure to the element E-710 may have caused his younger self’s developing brain to develop differently causing his interesting condition. Scientists trying to cure his condition realized how great this could be for all Helldivers, creating a batch of highly experimental E-710 pills for a group of select children of varying intelligence. Experiment:XXXXXXXXX was tough to carry out and the results were quite varied. No matter the intelligence of children, the effect of the pills didn't seem to do much. Kids either get full on brain damage, hyper focus, full-body paralysis, or receive no pain. This experiment was an overall XXXXXX and this subject needs to be further researched upon.  
  
Service in the 101st:

After enlisting through Steroids affirmation. He was a private

under Steroids rule. Crumbs spent most of his free time doing XXXXXXX and XXXXXXX. Though he didn’t know it, most of his sargents kept a keen eye on him. Quite quickly, Crumbs went from private to corporal very quickly. As he showed his sharp skills on the field, ordering privates around though he was still a private. Being a new corporal. He started to create a slew of deployments, attacking the automaton frontline and repelling the bugs. Multiple cases from privates (Who are sadly not with us anymore) tell us how his leadership skills were like no other. Delivering orders like no other, while still watching out for his team. One private said “Dude! Crumbs is crazy, like he took one glance at the map and identified a stalker lair right after we dropped down!” Unfortunately, PVT-XXXXXXXX died in a stalker encounter after the aforementioned deployment. Through a series of major orders and mass deployments, Crumbs climbed the ranks quickly leading to who he is today.
