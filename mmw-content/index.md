After retiring from active duty in the 51st Inferno Battalion "Mind" assume command of the 101st Hell Battalion

The 101st Hell Battalion was a ragtag and disorganized group, often ridiculed and underestimated by their peers. As quickly as Mind assumed command the 101st was rapidly transformed into an organized fighting force that gave hope to the civilians they saved and invoked fear in the hearts of the wretched enemies of liberty before their swift eradication, the 101st were reborn and willing to deploy into hell itself as under the command of Mind they felt certain of victory no matter the odds.

- the "[[heat-index|H.E.A.T. ]] division" they manage a in depth class system with training tiers and difficulty levels respective to certain players skill levels in the game.  

- the "Helmet design department" Making sure everyone who is SGT and above receives a custom designed helmet similar to the one i am wearing right now  

- "Ministry of Truth" Making sure all important community lore is written down in the history channel, creating advertisements and recruiting new members to the community 

- "[[ia-resources|Internal Affairs]] Department" If you are unhappy or if you feel damaged in any sort of way from one of our members please make an IA complaint and our IA dept will make sure to investigate the issue.
