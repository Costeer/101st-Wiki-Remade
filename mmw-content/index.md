This is the WIKI of the 101st "Hell" Battalion, the most active Helldivers 2 Millsim Server.

After retiring from active duty in the 51st Inferno Battalion "Mind" assume command of the 101st Hell Battalion

The 101st Hell Battalion was a ragtag and disorganized group, often ridiculed and
underestimated by their peers. As quickly as Mind assumed command the 101st was rapidly
transformed into an organized fighting force that gave hope to the civilians they saved and
invoked fear in the hearts of the wretched enemies of liberty before their swift eradication, the 101st were reborn and willing to deploy into hell itself as under the command of Mind they felt certain of victory no matter the odds.
