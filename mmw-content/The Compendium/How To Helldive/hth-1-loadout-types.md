title: 1 Loadouts Types
---
Hello Divers! This is Loadouts explained. This document will show you what types of weapons there are and in Part 2 will show you how to make a proper loadout. As you may know, weapons can fit into different types at the same time.

**Types:** There are several types of weapons a Diver would bring for a loudout. 
- Generalist [GL]
- Single-Target [ST]
- Mobbing [MB]
- Crowd-Control [CC]
#### Generalist 
GL weapons are able to fill out each role to some extent. Good Single Target and Mobbing DMG or DPS, paired with some Stagger and Push. Examples would be the SG-225IE Breaker Incendiary and the SG-8P Punisher Plasma, Terminid and Automaton GL type weapon respectively. Each has CC capabilites, Incendiary and high Stagger, alongside mobbing groups of enemies and smashing single targets. Having these types of weapons can make a mission a lot better, as they fill out plenty of roles. 

#### Single-Target 
ST weapons are able to kill a singular enemy at a time. To make up for the lack of mobbing, these weapons are paired with high Stagger or Push and have a fast TTK. Examples would be the JAR-5 Dominator or the SG-8 Punisher, both have amazing ST DMG and good CC capabilities. These weapons can help aid a team when there isn't enough fast ways to kill enemies. 

#### Mobbing 
MB weapons as stated in the name, are able to kill several or a dozen enemies faster than a Single-Target enemy could. These weapons usually have something aiding them to kill, Incendiary, high DPS, etc. Examples could be AR-23A Liberator Carbine, with its high DPS and fast RPM, it can take out several bugs in a couple of seconds. These weapons will aid in a team when there are too many enemies to take out, so bring one with you. 

#### Crowd-Control 
CC weapons are found with different categories, these weapon are able to Stagger, Push, and Flinch enemies EFFECTIVELY, unlike the Slugger... Weapons with strong CC capabilties would be the SG-8 Punisher, able to push enemies back effectively.
