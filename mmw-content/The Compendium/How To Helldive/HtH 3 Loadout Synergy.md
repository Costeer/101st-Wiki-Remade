**BEFORE READING THIS DOCUMENT** 

Hello Divers! This is Loadouts, explained. This document will show you how a mediocre Stratagem can become an extremely good Stratagem when paired with the right Loadout! _

**Basic Synergy**
Many weapons usually fill out one role within the Loadout, with other Stratagems filling out the other roles that the weapon itself cannnot fill out. However, many Stratagems can be paired with other weapons to unlock more playstyles and help that specific weapon with its weakness. 

**How to Synergise a Loadout**
All weapons have set Armour Penetration levels, being scaled on 0 - 10. Weapons such as the Grenade Launcher have an AP level of 3 / 10, giving it Type 1 Medium Armour Penetration, this means it cannot penetrate Bile Titan Armour at a level of 5 / 10 on the body, and 6 / 10 on the leg. This weapon is extremely good at mobbing but it unable to take out Heavy Targets. To make up for this downside a Diver could use a 500 KG, or make a synergy within the Loadout by using the Eagle 110 mm Rocket Pods. When used correctly the Eagle 110 can knock off the side Armour of the Bile Titan, which allows for the Grenade Launcher to shoot around the area, killing the Titan in around 2 - 4 Shots, however it can still be more depending on how the Rocket Pods land. 

You need to consider all pros on cons of a specific Stratagem, and pair it up with another Stratagem that can help fill out a small gap within the area you need filling out, as well as filling out another area. An example would be the GL-21 Grenade Launcher given in the prior paragraph - The Grenade Launcher can damage Bile Titans but only the Bile Sack, however when using the Rocket Pods correctly, the Grenade Launcher can directly damage the Bile Titan.
