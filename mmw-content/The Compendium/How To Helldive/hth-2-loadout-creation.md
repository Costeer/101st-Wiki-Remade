**BEFORE READING THIS DOCUMENT** 

Hello Divers! This is Loadouts, explained. This document will show you how you can use the several types of weaponry within our arsenal to make a Jack-of-all-Trades loadout or a specialised one! 

**Loadout Creation - Basics**
Depending on which enemies you're facing, each type of weapon may be prioritised over others. When making a Generalist loadout, you may want to use Generalist stratagems and weapons, the PLAS-1 Scorcher and the AC-8 Autocannon can be paired as generalists. If you want to run a weapon that is Single-Target, you may want to bring a weapon that leans more to the mobbing side, vice versa. When fighting bugs, Generalists like the SG-225IE and the ARC-12 are strong options as well as Mobbing weapons are decently strong. Single-Target weapons are not as need but can still be strong options. When fighting bots, Generalists like the SG-8P and PLAS-1 are strong options. However, unlike Terminids, Single-Target weapons are a decent margin better than Mobbing weapons. However, if you'd like a specialised build, spending your Primaries, Secondaries, Supports, and 1 or 2 Stratagems helping with that specific loadout type, will be a good option, however, spending all of your stratagems on 1 type may lead to holes within your loadout, causing you to be unable to kill specific enemies fast. 

_**How to Pair Weapons**_ 
Many weapons can have synergy, having weapons that match together because they fill out each other's weaknesses is a good way to find how to pair a weapon. The SG-8 Punisher is good at Stagger and Single-Target killing but is unable to kill each enemy fast enough to fight a horde quickly, pairing it with a mobbing weapon like the GL-21 Grenade Launcher would be extremely helpful it, covering its mobbing weakness.
