## Temporary Note

If you want to contribute a new [[notes|note]] to the wiki it is important that you remember that:
- note titles need to be all lowercase and without spaces use `-` instead
- all notes (exept notes found in the "Contributing" folder) need a header like this one
	![[header--heat-faq.png]]
	you can find a [Krita](https://krita.org/en/) file in the "01-Picture/edeting" directory
- If you're not a regular contributor new notes need to be discussed with Costeer
