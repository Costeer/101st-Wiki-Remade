### What is [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/)
besides the mineral Obsidian is a electron based Markdown editor.
If only half of those words made sense to you then don't worry i will explain most of them.
All files in the wiki are written in markdown a open standard for creating text files like a .txt so why not just use .txt files? well markdown offers some expanded functionalety when it comes to taking notes/writing stuff for example:
# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3 

Headers or **Bold** and *Italic* text 
Discord also uses a modified version of markdown for text formatting so most thing you will learn about the markdown syntax will be applicable in discord.

### Why Obsidian
we use obsidian in the wiki because it has:

1. Support for Plugins and CSS snippets
2. Uses markdown
3. Is compatible wit quartz (the back end of the wiki)
4. Is what i used before building the Wiki

**What are CSS snippets?**
CSS is a programming language used to style elements on websites and other stuff like electron based applications like obsidian. CSS snippets are small bits of CSS code we can use to style text displayed in obsidian differently than it normally would see [[custom-formatting-features]] for examples.
