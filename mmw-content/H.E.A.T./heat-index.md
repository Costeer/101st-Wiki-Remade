## What is H.E.A.T. ?
Helldivers Environmental Advanced Training is a class system developed by the best and brightest of the 101st. It is a way to showcase your abilities and mastery with a certain playstyle and set of equipment.
 
The HEAT classes developed by our team have high synergistic capabilites and were developed with battlefield effectiveness in mind. The goal of HEAT is to hilight our most elite heroes and distinguish them among our ranks based on their individual skills and specialties. 

Certification of these classes requires full completion of a set of challenges that will be proctored by a HEAT Division Member.

Upon completion you will recieve a special HEAT role signifying the class you have been certified for. You will also be granted access to NULL-DIVER challenges, which are reserved for only the most elite among our ranks. Stay tuned for more information on this in the near future.
