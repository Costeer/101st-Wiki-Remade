**Q:** What happens if I fail a test?
**A:** There are no permanent repercussions, but you will be required to wait one week before testing again.

**Q:** What is the reward for H.E.A.T. Training?
**A:** There is no reward. Training does not give rank or respect; the main goal is to show to others that you are officially competent at a class. This helps deployment hosts more accurately judge the abilities of their squad.

**Q:** Is H.E.A.T. a requirement?
**A:** NO. With enforcement from General Mind, H.E.A.T. is entirely separate from your ranks and honor in this battalion. Ranks are evaluated by leading, managing, and being a part of the battalion; H.E.A.T. is evaluated by skills and knowledge on the field of democracy.

**Q:** Can I apply to the H.E.A.T. division?
**A:** Not through training or certifications. Thereâ€™s a mighty difference between being able to pass challenges and developing, testing and managing the entire system behind it.

**Q:** Am I stuck to one class of H.E.A.T.?

**Q:** Can I only run the loadouts I have learned?
**A:** H.E.A.T. does not limit your playstyle in any way; we simply offer organized and efficient roles that are meant to mesh. If you have something that works you can use that, always
