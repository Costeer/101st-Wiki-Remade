### The system is broken down into 5 Tiers.  
  
**Tier 0:** 
Every person who completed their basic training starts at T0. This tier has no restrictions or demands - this allows the new trainees to play with whatever playstyle they desire.  
  
**Tier 1:** 
This is where you pick a specialty from one of our 5 categories. You now start to focus on these playstyles.  
  
**Tier 2:** 
Now you further refine your skills into a specific playstyle.  
  
**Tier 3:** 
You have become an expert in your chosen playstyle, so now you start to diversify your skill set and pass your T1 for a different category.  
  
**Tier 4:** 
You are now a master at your playstyle, not being able to advance any further, you now shift your focus to your next chosen speciality.


# <div class="dividernc">OFFENSE</div>

Within this category of classes your goal is to bring death and destruction to all enemies of Democracy that stand in your way. You are the front line - pushing forward - to keep progressing in the name of Super Earth.  
  
Here the category is broken down into 3 segments: 
- AOE (Area of Effect)  
- INF (Infantry)  
- AT (Anti-Tank)

  
Each of these represent a class - AKA playstyle. These are not restrictions on weapons, but rather stipulations as to how you play them. When you choose one of these roles you adopt a mindset as to who you become. Whether it be a lead-slinging maniac of death, a harbinger of explosive doom or a crazed madman wielding the power of lightning, this is the Helldiver you must become.

### Area of Effect

This role is your crazed madman wielding weapons that lay waste to large swathes of foes and cover an area in hell so that none may cross. With the GL-21 Grenade Launcher, FLAME-40 Flamethrower and, the ARC-3 Arc Thrower being weapons of choice as well as laughing in glory as their Napalm, Gas or Orbital Airburst blankets an area, these maniacs thrive in the chaos of a close quarters battle. 

  

Your job is to keep the foes under pressure all the time and keep their attention as much as you can. This can be a hard battle as you get constantly swarmed or pinned down with rocket fire but trust in your armor and stims to keep you in the front lines.  
  
However, be aware of where your teammates are, many of these weapons of mass destruction, your teammates can easily be caught up in your chaos. Communication is key to avoid FF incidents

### Infantry

This role is your front-lines leadslinger. Using your trusty tools of death and destruction you lay waste to huge swathes of enemies, a few dozen rounds at a time. Trust in your trigger finger to never let up and keep that hail of bullets flying. You revel in the swarms of patrols, as these are your purpose, when the numbers show, you are happy to kill.  
  
Most often relying on the portable M-105 Stalwart or the MG-43 Machine Gun alongside the Orbital Gatling, Eagle Strafing Run and Orbital Barrages to ensure complete area bombardment and team advance. Keep an eye on your six and your ammo as the last thing you want is needing to reload amidst a swarm of bugs or a hail of rockets.


Positioning is key with these weapons as concentrated fire down corridors or just simply lining up your targets is helpful to conserve ammo and avoid your teamates getting fresh piercings courtesy of you!

### Light Anti-Tank

When playing in this role, you become the bane of all Hulks and Chargers. Taking charge with your primaries to clear the chaff and opening up to that Chargers face so you can remove it from their body, lining up that perfect shot to blow that hulk to smithereens. You revel and cackle everytime you stand on their corpse, ready for the next wave to come.  
  
Relying on your AC-8 Autocannon, EAT-17 Expendable Anti-Tank or the RS-422 Railgun with the Orbital Precision or Railcannon,your Eagle Airstrikes and the A/AC-8 Autocannon Sentry or A/MLS-4X Rocket Sentry to ensure complete deletion of all enemies of democracy.

  

This class excels when paired with one of the other chaff clear or AT types as this is sort of a hybrid between those two, so you have to learn to adapt to your squad - filling in what is needed and when. Your turrets are your best friend in helping to keep the populations quelled. Just be careful not to end up another statistic of turret kills. They do not care about you.

# <div class="dividernc">Support</div>

Within this category of classes your goal is to support your teammates as they fulfill their jobs. In order to spread Democracy to all corners of the galaxy, you team needs ammo, stims and cover. And when the biggest of enemies rear their ugly heads, you send them to the void. 


Here the category is broken down into three segments:  
  
- HAT (Heavy Anti-Tank)
- SUP (Suppressive Fire)  
- QM (Quartermaster) 


Each of these represent a class - AKA playstyle. These are not restrictions on weapons, but rather stipulations as to how you play them. When you choose one of these roles you adopt a mindset as to who you become. Whether you take out your extreme prejudice on the largest of foes, play party moma/papa and keep everyone all topped up on ammo and stims or take maniacal joy in dumping so much lead at the enemy that the planet will weep lead, this is the Helldiver you must become.

### Heavy Anti-Tank

As this role you are the bane of anything above a Hulk or Charger. When they rear their ugly face, you grin from ear to ear - eager to send them to oblivion. 

With your GR-8 Recoilless Rifle, LAS-99 Quasar Cannon or FAF-14 Spear. Alongside that you pack the Orbital Precision Strike or Railcannon Strike, you look for the biggest targets and eradicate them

Be mindful of your range though, as the bane of your existence is the small little chaff. Trust in your team to keep the little guys off you so you can deal with the big fellas. This class pairs well with the QM as well by allowing them to take your backpack and reload you. Just don’t be running too far from them

### Supressive
As this role you are the incarnation of Hell - bullet Hell. You job is to take the meaning of “Ammo dump” and redefine the dictionary to say “See this person”. Super Earth gave us all the ammo, you make sure it gets used. 

Heading into battle you wield your MG-206 Heavy Machine Gun or the MG-43 Machine Gun and your HMG Emplacement. This alongside a handy Supply Pack or Energy Shield really sets you up for ultimate carnage.

Just keep in mind that yes, you want to ensure you blanket the area in front of you in lead but you are not as mobile as the Infantry. You do pack a punch though so don’t be afraid to tackle bigger targets. You also act as a sort of “safe zone” to allow your allies some time to breath/reload if they need it.

### Quartermaster
As this role you are the teams Mama/Papa. You follow around your little kids as they denture forth causing havoc in the name of Super Earth. But as any kids, they get cuts and bruises and run out of stims, their guns run dry and their grenade belts are empty.

Packing your B-1 Supply Pack and LAS-98 Laser Cannon as well as some Smokes and Energy Shield Relays to create that little safe space for your kids to fall back to when they need help.  

This is a very high upkeep role and generally nets you the one dishing out commands - so if you find yourself often leading and liking to support, this may be the playstyle for you. Sit back, watch and let you kids(team) have fun!

# <div class="dividernc">Defense</div>

Within this category of classes your goal is to secure and defense with your sentries, smokes and mines. Whether you find yourself defending HV assets, holding down the E-170 pumps or just simply moving from one spot to the next, make use of Super Earths finest AI (Not intelligent) to help defend yourself and quell the enemy forces.

Here the category is broken down into three segments:  
  
- SD (Stationary Defence)
- MD (Mobile Defence)  
- PD (Passive Defence) 

Each of these represent a class - AKA playstyle. These are not restrictions on weapons, but rather stipulations as to how you play them. When you choose one of these roles you adopt a mindset as to who you become. Whether you prefer to hold your ground and let none pass, use your turrets as a second or third man or prefer the more stealthy and incapacitating approach, this is the Helldiver you must become.

### Stationary Defense

As this role you are the bastion of defence, the first and last line. You utilize the powers of your sentries to make a stand and hold your place letting no bug or bot get through.

  

By bringing a various assortment of MG, Gatling, Autocannon and Rocket sentries as well as Shield relays and your trusty Flam-40 Flamethrower or RL-77 Airburst Rocket Launcher to pack an extra punch when needed, nothing gets past you.  
  
The biggest thing with this role is knowing how to space out your sentries. Both in location and uptime. Sometimes you need the firepower of multiples all at once, but keep in mind, that may have you defenceless for a time. Spacing them out to have one always active may be the better choice.

### Mobile Defense

As this role you are the harbinger of death. Bringing your tech with you as you traverse the battlefield and using them to add extra firepower and keep the attention of the enemy. You turn the bugs to mist and use the bots own tech against them. 

  
By bringing a various assortment of MG, Gatling, Autocannon and Rocket sentries as well as Shield relays and your trusty GL-21 Grenade Launcher or the RS-422 Railgun to pack an extra punch when needed, you bring the death to the enemy.  
  
The biggest thing with this role is knowing how to space out your sentries. Both in location and uptime. As you are constantly on the run, making sure to always have at least one sentry available is key - especially if you do not bring a support weapon. Understand how your sentries target and what they can kill is also key.

### Passive Defense
As this role you are the quiet, sneaky and annoying class for the enemy. However, to your teammates - although you do not have many ways of killing the enemy - you excel at keeping them unaware or off balance. 

  

You trust in your AP, INC and AT Mines, EMS Mortar, Orbital EMS and Smokes to blind and slow the enemy as well as stop them in their tracks. Never leave your destroyer without your LAS-98 Laser Cannon as sometimes, you have no choice but to kill.  
  
This is a difficult role, but very satisfying to play. You have to understand that you will always have the least kills, and learning the best places to put your EMS and Smokes is tricky, Mines can be even harder to figure out (Note: Tremors will instantly destroy all mines). But if you can master this, you will become such a valuable member of the party that people will be fighting over you!

# <div class="dividernc">Scout</div>

Within this category of classes your goal is to sneak around and complete the smaller objectives. Whether that be hunting down POI’s and Samples, Scouting out patrols or trashing every structure in sight. Your tactics are hit and run or just don’t be seen. You keep a long way from the main squad but that does not make you a lone gun. 

Here the category is broken down into three segments:  

- RDR (Radar)
- SKV (Scavenger)  
- DEMO (Demolitionist)  

Each of these represent a class - AKA playstyle. These are not restrictions on weapons, but rather stipulations as to how you play them. When you choose one of these roles you adopt a mindset as to who you become. Whether you prefer to sneak around with your long range rifle and watch your team - calling out any potential threats, running around being a little sample goblin or, wielding your FAF and making sure there is no structure left standing, this is the Helldiver you must become.

### Radar
As this role you are the quiet, sneaky scout. You take up a long range position from the main party and keep your eyes peeled for any and all potential threats - you do prefer NOT to engage as this does give away your position but if need be, trust your aim to be true. One shot, One kill. 

Packing your APW-1 Anti-Material Rifle, LIFT-850 Jetpack, and Smokes, your gear is not your class. You are. Your skills at stealth and aim are what is important.

Shhhh. This is your word. Scout armor and patience are your friend. Most enemies will ignore you if you go prone and crawl past. If you need to, any hellpod strat can be used as a distraction for patrols so you can safely sneak by (Just make sure to throw it on the other side of the patrol from you). Practice your aim as if you do need to shoot something you want to get it done as quickly as you can.

### Scavenger
As this role you are the sample goblin. You are the one who loves to run around the map (Seemingly senseless - don’t question the hunt) and gather every POI and completing the small objectives.

The M-105 Stalwart and EAT-17 Expendable Anti-Tank are your best friends. Paired with an Orbital Precision Strike, Eagle Cluster Bombs, Orbital Gatling Barrage or Orbital Gas Strike, these are your tools to deal with small patrols and outposts/nests quickly. 


Scout or Engineer armors work the best. Just remember that although you pack all the tools needed to deal with small stuff - you are not a 1-man army. Your tactic is SPEED. If you have to waste time fighting or waiting, you’re not doing it right. Big maps need lots of attention. Don’t get caught up in firefights. (Sentries are helpful for getting away, they draw enemy fire allowing you an escape)

### Demolitionist
As this role you are the bane of any structure in the game. Fabricators, Spore Spewers, Shriker Nests, Detector Towers. Anything you can trash or destroy is your pick. Bull in a china shop - trashing everything in its path. 


Packing your FAF-14 Spear or the MLS-4X Commando alongside the Orbital Precision Strike, Eagle Airstrike, 120MM Barrage, or Orbital Laser - you bring everything that can cause massive destruction.

You focus on structures - this does mean that you can fall lacking on Chaff clear or fighting heavies so make sure you have someone who can take care of those for you. 120MM and 380MM are great for softening up bases and trashing lots in there before you start an attack. Don’t hesitate to use them.

# <div class="dividernc">Mechanized</div>

Within this category of classes your goal is to bring the armor. Super Earth saw fit to train you in how to use some of the most expensive gear, so you chose how to make the best of it. There is no better feeling than the THUD of an Exo-suit hitting the ground.

Here the category is broken down into three segments:  
  
- EXO (Exo-suits)
- APC (Armored Personnel Carriers)  
- ATV (All Terrain Vehicles)

Each of these represent a class - AKA playstyle. These are not restrictions on weapons, but rather stipulations as to how you play them. When you choose one of these roles you adopt a mindset as to who you become. Whether you pack a punch with the Exo-suits, offer reliable and durable transportation or focus on getting the team around the map quickly, this is the Helldiver you must become.

### Exo-suits
As this role you are the walking armor. You bring the heavy-duty war machines capable of insurmountable death and destruction. You become the machine to kill the machine.  
  
Expert pilot of both the EXO-49 Emancipator and EXO-45 Patriot suits, you bring the hulks of steel to bear on all but the toughest foes and you stand your ground.  
  
Although the mechs are tough, they are not unkillable, so learning how to keep your machine alive as long as you can is key. Ammo conservation is also important. Don’t waste half your ammo on one Bile Titan when your Spear gunner can take him down in 1-2 shots. Spears can be reloaded, the Mechs cannot. Also, remember even if you are out of ammo or missing your arms you can still stomp and it’s reliable transportation. Use the mech until it is completely gone.
