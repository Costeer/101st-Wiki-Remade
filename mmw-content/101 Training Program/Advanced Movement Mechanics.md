### Movement Speeds

Depending on a situation, the team might be required to move at different speeds in order to move effectively as a unit. It could be used to slow down to let others catch up while still maintaining movement at all times to not be vulnerable or to speed up to catch with the others or to approach an objective much faster.

##### Single Time:

Walking Pace by only holding the “W” key to initiate slow movement. Great to be used when you want to rally with another squad or team however you want to slow down to give them time to catch up to your pace or position. Can still serve other purposes however would generally be used this way.

##### Double Time:

Normal Sprinting Pace by holding the “W” key and the “Sprint” key. This will normally be used to get from A to B and will be consistent with the rest of the squad. All classes will be double time.

##### Triple Time: 

Fast Running Pace by utilizing equipment available or utility. This is used to get to an objective as fast as possible and with as little downtime, usually used to capture an objective or to board a Pelican.

### General Movement

##### Situational Awareness:

Situational Awareness is simply about knowing what is going on around you and how you can use that knowledge to survive. This training will go more in depth about types of things to be aware of however it is good to have a general idea of what it means.

If you want to succeed in this unit and become a better rifleman, you need to know this. It is not because of your aim or your unluckiness, it is about knowing how to survive by being cautious and knowing the hazards around you. This skill can be taught but only through practice and continuous use of it. Knowing maps is part of situational awareness and can only help you succeed.

##### Moving to Cover:

Although it sounds like a very obvious topic to cover, it is not utilized enough. Every moment, you are not in cover, you are vulnerable, no matter how secure you think you are. If you are capturing your objective for example, you can very easily get sniped on the point across the map if you are standing still exposed. You must always be aware of the path you take and utilize the most cover possible to move to it and reduce your own exposure as well as your team. Although there will not always be cover available in an open field, it is your job to find as much defilade or any natural land cover to position yourself in or to move in to cover as soon as you cross the open field.

#### Spacing

Spacing is putting distance between you and your team in order to spread out and reduce area of effect damage. The two types of spacing commonly used are: Formal and Combat Spacing.

##### Formal Spacing:

Formal Spacing is lining up either shoulder to shoulder or back to back spacing which is used to line up or stay in formations before moving into a combat zone. This is usually used to organize members into the right squad or unit.

#### Combat Spacing:

Around 5-10 meters apart will be considered combat spacing. This is used to reduce the amount of damage something does to the squad overall. A hostile grenade will be more deadly if everyone stood together in a tight knit formation rather than if everyone was spread out and it only hit one person.  

This is especially effective against spewers. They can for example attack multiple enemies at once with their spit attack. Spreading out, shooting them from different angles, and dodging abilities will help eliminate the target. It gives you more time to do damage and less time for the Spewer to damage you.

#### Compass and Mini-Map Management

Being able to understand how the Compass and Mini-Map work will help you in every scenario. The Compass will help in your situational awareness as it will tell you the positioning of the environment, objectives, allies, and enemies.

  
If you want to improve your calls, use your Compass to tell directions like North East, Southwest, etc.

#### Squad Movement:

Not only that but you must ensure that you are not in large clumps on the map as indicated on the Mini-Map.  You want to make sure that your teammates are not in your inner circle because it is not combat spacing which means you leave you and your teammate vulnerable. If your teammate does not pay attention to their spacing, do your part and move away from them.

#### Lone Wolfing

Lone Wolfing is defined as someone who prepares and commits to an action alone, outside of any command structure and without material assistance from any group. If your course is moving you away from your teammates and you do not see anything on your mini-map, it means you are lone wolfing. You want to avoid this habit at all costs because you are putting your team at risk by doing so. Unless it was an organized play that you planned for with your team, lone wolfing is considered detrimental to your team and something you should not do. As the mentality check states, the mission and people first, always go with your team unless given permission to split off.
