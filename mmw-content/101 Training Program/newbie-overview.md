## Rules
We don't have that many rules in this server but if you are unsure about certain edge cases you can always consult the [[rules]] page on here
## Tools
there are a few tools people in the server use to make your life easier you can look them up here [[useful-tools]] if you have any more tools that you think might be helpful to other Helldivers please message on of the Contributors of the wiki!

## Do you have Questions?
Message your CO (Commanding Officer) if you are a CDT that would be any SM (Sergeant Major) and if you are a PVT that is your Sergeant/Corporal that's why they exist!
