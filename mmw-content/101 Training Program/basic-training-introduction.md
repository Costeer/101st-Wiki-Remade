Welcome to the 101st Basic Cadet Training (BCT) Program, where we mold mere mortals into the fearless defenders of liberty and democracy. Get ready to embrace the irony of sweating profusely while reciting the Pledge of Allegiance.

In our illustrious BCT Program, cadets will have the distinct honor of mastering the art of democracy by following orders without question. Because what's more democratic than being told exactly what to do, when to do it, and how to do it?

Prepare yourselves, cadets, for a journey filled with more regulations than the entire Bill of Rights. Because in our program, freedom means knowing the difference between a left face and a right face, and liberty is found at the bottom of a canteen during a hydration break.

Forget about the pursuit of happiness; in our program, we pursue physical exhaustion and mental anguish with unmatched fervor. Because nothing screams "liberty" like blistered feet and sleepless nights, am I right?

So congratulations, cadets, on embarking on this epic journey of self-discovery and profound suffering. Remember, as you slog through the trenches of BCT, you're not just becoming soldiers – you're becoming the living embodiment of sarcasm, patriotism, and the Super Earth way.

The Basic Training is divided into 5 Sections and can be read in any order, although reading

first is recommended as it explains some common terminology.
