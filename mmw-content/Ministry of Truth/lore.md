Once upon a time, in a land where patriotism burned brighter than the sun, there existed the 51st Inferno Battalion, renowned for their unwavering loyalty and fierce dedication to the cause of liberty and democracy. At the heart of this venerated battalion was a soldier unlike any other, Mind. His name was earned through his exceptional tactical and strategic mindset which in battles that were considered by Super Earth Tactical Command to of been unwinnable fights.

Mind’s brilliance in combat defied the odds and in every battle his battalion faced they achieved resounding victories.

Mind had seen it all in his glorious career– from the scorching battlefields where every step
forward was paid for in blood to the quiet moments of camaraderie shared around campfires
where the fallen were honored and remembered. He had fought tirelessly and unyielding, his soul ablaze with the fervor of patriotism and devotion to bringing the light of liberty to the darkest corners of known space. But as the years wore on, and the flames of conflict dimmed Mind found himself facing a new battle against time itself as, though he had earned victories and glories some of which the Super President himself had honored him for, he begrudgingly realized age was taking its toll on him.


With a heavy heart, BC-01 "Mind" bid farewell to the 51st Inferno Battalion as he retired from
active duty and though his soldiers lamented the departure of such an exceptional brother in arms they pledged to fight in his honour and uphold his legacy as they charged into new battles to further the cause of liberty and democracy. Though he wished he could continue to fight with the 51st, Mind was proud of what he was leaving behind as he faced what came next.


However, retirement did not quench the fire within Mind. It was a time of contemplation and
renewal as his devotion to Super Earth burned brighter than ever before and he wished to lead warriors of liberty to glory once more. Merely a few years later, his dream was made manifest as SATC urgently requested he assume command of the 101st Hell Battalion which without hesitation or doubt Mind eagerly agreed to.


The 101st Hell Battalion was a ragtag and disorganized group, often ridiculed and underestimated by their peers. As quickly as Mind assumed command the 101st was rapidly
transformed into an organized fighting force that gave hope to the civilians they saved and
invoked fear in the hearts of the wretched enemies of liberty before their swift eradication, the 101st were reborn and willing to deploy into hell itself as under the command of Mind they felt certain of victory no matter the odds.


As Mind led his battalion into battle once more, his body felt renewed strength through his
burning devotion to liberty and Super Earth, as he led his men from the front and even in the
midst of battle maintained complete control over his forces. They fought not just for victory, but for the ideals that they held dear; freedom, justice, brotherhood and the prosperity of humanity. 


And so, amidst the chaos of war, Mind stood tall, a beacon of hope amidst the darkness as he charged headstrong side by side with those he commanded into the flames of war that reforged him from not just a soldier but a living legend who’s acts of bravery and defiance against the enemies of liberty served as an example to his soldiers emboldening them to fight with unyielding ferocity and patriotism.

In the wake of their first deployment, BC-01 "Mind" found himself standing shoulder to shoulder with a new breed of warriors – CPL-2245 "Freeze", CPL-0511 "Goon", and CPL-0001
"HellRider". Each was a soldier of immense prowess with unique strengths and quirks, united
they formed an unbreakable bond of brotherhood forged in the crucible of battle.

Their first deployment had been a baptism of fire against the Automaton scourge, a test of their mettle that they had emerged from stronger and more determined than ever before as the mechanical enemy was reduced to scrap metal in the wake of their victory. As they stood on the precipice of their next mission, BC-01 "Mind" felt as certain as his pride in liberty that they were ready. Against whatever foe dared to stand against the 101st they would prevail and further the cause of spreading liberty across the galaxy.


With the success of their first mission, each member of the squad was rewarded with the
opportunity to lead their own squad – a testament to their bravery and skill on the battlefield. For CPL-2245 "Freeze", it was a chance to harness his tactical brilliance and lead with icy precision, be it bot or beast he would see whatever foe he faced shattered and purged for democracy. CPL-0511 "Goon" embraced the opportunity to unleash his raw strength and unwavering loyalty on the battlefield as whatever enemy he faced would be shattered by his might. CPL-0001 "HellRider" surged into battle with a fearless spirit sustained by a burning desire to see liberty achieved and to protect his comrades at any cost. CPL-2907 “Cleanser” impressed Mind with his zealous devotion to liberty as if he were a Templar knight of ancient times reborn to serve Super Earth as he charged into the heart of battle sparing no pity or remorse for the machine menace as he brutally annihilated any that stood in his way.


As each member of the squad marched onward to their own futures full of glory and patriotic duty, BC-01 "Mind" watched with pride, knowing that he had played a part in shaping these warriors into the venerable leaders they had become. Though their paths diverged, their bond remained unbreakable, forged in the inferno of warfare and tempered by the fires of adversity. 


And so, the journey continued for BC-01 "Mind" and his squad, as they faced each new challenge with courage, determination, and the unshakable belief that together, they could
overcome anything. For in the heart of every warrior burned the flames of patriotism, lighting the way forward as they marched ever onward, ready to face whatever the future held in store for the brave 101st Hell Batallion.
