Deployments can sometimes be hard to understand so here is a quick rundown 

### If you want to join a deployment

![[Pasted image 20240819190706.png|300]]



this is the channel to look for one 

in this channel you will find messages of SPC and higher
they look something like this:
![[Pasted image 20240819190831.png]]

this is a deployment message lets break it down into smaller pieces to make it easier to explain 

at the top you can see who posted the deployment and what it is called

![[Pasted image 20240819190939.png]]

beneath the title you will find the **Event info** tab where you can see for what time/date this deployment is

![[Pasted image 20240819191046.png|300]]

this deployment is for the 19.08.2024 at 21:00 this time changes based on your timezone so you don't have to worry about accounting for that

next in line is the the description:

![[Pasted image 20240819191315.png|350]]

this is **required to read** because sometimes deployments are only for a specific squad or require specific loadouts

*like in this example:*

Under that you will see the signups

Deployments have a cap of 4 players (just like the game)
you cant join a deployment if there are already 4 players in the deployment 

in this case we have me as offense and 3 others as Scouts so 4 players 

SPC Miku is signd up as backup 
backups are called if players don't attend the deployments have to leave and in other cases
#### How to sign up
If you have read the description and checked that you are available at the time of the deployment you can sign up

under the deployment message you can see 7 buttons:

![[Pasted image 20240819192008.png|450]]

the first 5 buttons are to sign up as a specific role in the deployment 
these rolls don't matter if the host doesn't use the class system witch will be in the description so if in doubt sign up as offense (first button)

the 6th button (blue) is used to sign up as backup
and the 7th (red) to leave the deployment.

### What happens now
you will get pinged 2 times in the departure channel before the deployment 

![[Pasted image 20240819192419.png|350]]

you get one ping normaly 1 hour before
and one ping 20 mins before

![[Pasted image 20240819201508.png|850]]

after the host has opens a deployment vc found at the bottom of the list you join that vc and the deployment should start shortly
