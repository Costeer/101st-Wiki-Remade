This will be a short course or Reminder on how to create and manage Departure Notices. If you have any Questions after this please feel free to message your Commanding Officer and if they are not reachable the Person above them.

I’m going to be splitting this Guide into 2 different Segments:

**[[#Departure Creation]]**:
 - [[#Creation]]
 - [[#Formatting]]
 
 **[[#Departure Rules]]**: 
- [[#Rules for Channel]]
- [[#Rules for Deployment]] 
- [[#Rules for Pinging Members/Backup]]


## Departure Creation:

### Creation:  
Creating a Departure only takes a few things, a Deployment Signup with at least 3 Members including yourself and also a given time for when the Deployment will be happening.  
In the “helldive-departures” channel you can find a pinned message by our Lord and Savior himself about how you could write your Departure Notices.  
The important Bits are: You need a header such as “Attention Helldivers”, a broadly written message including the Deployment name and when the Deployment starts, written in a Roleplay like fashion such as “Operation: “For the Battalion” has been approved by Super Earth High Command and will Commence in T-15 Minutes” and Pings for each of the Members. Below the pinged deployment members you are required to write a roleplay text in fashion of addressing the members as soldiers you are to take into battle. Something uplifting.  
It could look something like this:

After this is done you just have to hit enter and send your Departure Notice. 

### Formatting:  
There are a few formatting rules you have to follow when writing a Departure Notice:  
1. A header that states a variation of “Attention Helldivers”  
2. The Operation Name and time till Deployment start  
3. A Ping for every signed up Helldiver excluding yourself  
4. A different Section for Pinging Main Divers and Backup Divers  
5. Significant RP Elements
6. <span style="color:rgb(255, 87, 87)">A 15 minute departure notice is required. An 1 hour departure notice is optional.</span>

## Departure Rules:
### Rules for Channel:
<span style="color:rgb(255, 87, 87)">The Departure Channel is only to be used to post the 1 Hour Departure Notice and 15 Minutes Departure notice</span>. Anything else that has to do with the Deployment will be sent in either the Hub or in Dms. If for example you wish to inform the assigned Helldivers that you will be opening the Comms soon do so in the Hub. DO NOT make a separate message in the Departure Channel about you opening Comms.

Each Departure Notice must at least have a bit of Roleplay in it and will not be allowed to be too short. You can use the given Example above as a guideline of what is an acceptable length.
There may be two Departure Notices. There must be a 15 min Departure Notice. More than that is prohibited. <span style="color:rgb(255, 87, 87)">The only exception to this Rule are the Hot Drop Deployments which you can host on Weekends. They only require the 15 Minute Departure Notice.</span>
Do not have any casual chatter in the Departure Notice channel. If anything needs to be said, do it in another Channel.

### Rules for Deployment:

The Mission will start at the time given beforehand. If you set the Mission Start Time at 19:00 in the Signup then Members have time to join you till 19:00. If any of the main Mission Members have not shown up by then, they will get five extra minutes to join the Deployment. At 19:00 you are then requested to ping them in the Hub or in DMs to inform them that the Mission will be starting soon. If they do not respond within 5 Minutes you can ping one of your Backups again in either the Hub or Dms. If you do not have any Backups you can open the Deployment up to the entire battalion and also ask anyone you see in a voice channel if they wish to join you.

If one of the Members is misbehaving within your Deployments and does not better himself after you mention it to him, then you have the right to kick them and can also disconnect them from your Deployment VC (you have the ability to disconnect people from your own deployment vc). 
Do not abuse this. If High Command finds out you are abusing this there will be repercussions.

  
### Deployments have a few given rules that have been set up by High Command:

1. Deployments must have at least 3 members.
2. Deployments must have a total time of at least 45 minutes. (note TOTAL time. Not specifically IN MISSION time)
3. Deployments must consist of 3 drops. (even if you fail one, as long as you still do three it counts)
4. Deployments must take place in an official deployment voice channel.
5. Deployments must have a properly written departure notice(s), and a properly written tally to count.
6. Deployments must be hosted in difficulty T5 to T10. Anything below T5 will not count. 

<span style="color:rgb(255, 255, 0)">All 6 of these criteria must be met for the deployment to count. If even one of these is not met, it will not count.</span>

### Rules for Pinging Members/Backup:

As already stated above in Deployment Rules, if you wish to Ping the Members or Backup you will use the Hub Channel or Dms <span style="color:rgb(255, 87, 87)">NEVER use the Helldive Departures channel outside the 1 Hour and 15 Minutes Departure Notice. </span>
If for some reason one of your Squad Members lose connection or have to leave in the Middle of the Mission, you are free to call in your Backup. Give them a Ping in the Hub or DMs.

This Concludes this Course on Departure Notices. I hope this was helpful. Again if you have any more questions after this feel free to Message your Commanding Officers. I wish you all a wonderful day!
