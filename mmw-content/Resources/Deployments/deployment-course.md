###### <span style="color:rgb(195, 165, 168)">DEPLOYMENT GUIDE AND RULES. YOUR PATH TO A SUCCESSFUL DEPLOYMENT.</span>

With the new deployment bot "Athena" our deployment system is easier than ever.
There are now 2 different paths you can choose from when opting into an official 101st Deployment.

"[[#Option 1 - Hot Drops|Hot Drops]]" and "[[#Option 2 Scheduled Deployments|Scheduled Deployments]]"

### Option 1 Hot Drops
If you want to get right into the action you can head to the [Hot drop](https://discord.com/channels/1218615560049397770/1297308619641061397) Channel in the discord to be put into a deployment ASAP.

- **SPC rank or higher** you can click the "Host" button to be placed into Athena's queue as a host.

- **PVT rank or higher** you can click the "Join" button to be placed into Athena's queue as a participant.

Once you have selected an option, you will be placed into Athena's queue, she will begin going through the list of sign ups and will begin matchmaking deployments automatically.
If you wish to remove yourself from the queue, click the "Leave" button!

Once Athena has chosen you for a deployment, she will create a Departure Notice with pings for the host and the chosen participants automatically in the [Helldive departures](https://discord.com/channels/1218615560049397770/1297304177021685821) channel in the discord.

Athena will also at this time automatically create a Voice Channel with access limited to the deployment members. You have up to 15 minutes to join the official VC once it has been created.

Once an hour has passed and all members have left the VC it will be taken down by Athena.

### Option 2 Scheduled Deployments
If you are of SPC rank or higher and wish to Host a deployment at a specific time and date, you may do so within the [Create a deployment](https://discord.com/channels/1218615560049397770/1297304898446164121) channel in the discord.

Once you are within the "create-a-deployment" channel, go to the Athena bot and click on the "New Deployment" button.

After you have clicked the button, Athena will pop up and ask you to provide the details of your deployment, please do so accurately.

![[athenaBot-newDeploymentCard.png]]

Take special care to fill out the last box exactly as shown using the `"YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM UTC(+/-)X" format`
```
Examples 
2024-10-14 16:30 UTC-7
2024-10-16 05:30 UTC+5
```
If you input this information incorrectly Athena will not process your request.
If you are unsure of your timezone value for UTC please visit the following links below to ensure you add the appropriate value after "UTC" when submitting your deployment to Athena.

https://www.timeanddate.com/time/map/

Once you have given Athena all the information she needs, click the "Submit" button and she will respond with the following message:

![[athenaBot-selectChannel.png]]

After Athena asks you to select a channel, click the "Select a Channel" dropdown menu and you will see the following 3 options:

![[athenaBot-selectChannel2.png]]

The options include the following:
- **Battalion** deployments open to the entire Battalion, heroes of PVT rank or above may join, regardless of region.
- **EU** seperate deployment channel for heroes ranked PVT or above who are based in a EU company.
- **NA** seperate deployment channel for heroes ranked PVT or above who are based in a NA company.

Once you select a channel, Athena will respond with "Deployment Created Successfully" and she will post your deployment signup in the appropriate channel based on your selection.

![[channelListDeployments.png]]

Within the channel you selected, you will now see your deployment signup open for others to register. Athena will automatically sign you up as "Offense" if you created the deployment, but you can change your role at any time using the "Select role to sign up" drop down menu at the bottom of the post.

![[athenaBot-message.png]]

You will also see 2 additional buttons at the bottom of your signup

- **Delete Deployment** will cancel your deployment and remove your signup. There is no confirmation on this, so don't click this button unless you are sure you want to scrub the operation.
- **Edit Deployment** will let you change your signup details if you wish to make changes after posting.

![[athenaBot-selectOption.png]]

![[athenaBot-selectEdit.png]]

15 minutes before your deployment is slated to begin, Athena will Create a private Voice Channel for use during your deployment.

At this time Athena will also create a departure notice with pings for host and participants.

Once your Deployment is complete, you have **48** hours to post a proper Deployment Tally in the [deployment tallies](https://discord.com/channels/1218615560049397770/1227727893740781719)  channel.

If you are to write your tally within the discord channel itself, **you must**, at minimum, follow the format provided here [Discord template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Sn6gsPAzKgqqhBUZ6ydYEjyEe58B2_G7Tesu7nAVKGQ/edit)

If you wish to utilize our google doc system instead of writing the tally within Discord itself, **you must**, at minimum, use the sheet provided here [SITREP template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xkLRULZne8kqpC5HCleaOTFmA7CPEQbTKBdoJqrdGiE/edit?tab=t.0)

When posting the link to your google sheet/tally **you must** follow the format provided here [SITREP template example](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cn5v5WVoKbprx652FLgBEVDKSPKaNJIyA3_yaWWhGlg/edit?usp=sharing)


We encourage creative freedom, however, the telly channel is our only enforced RP channel and we take it very seriously.

You are free to add to the provided examples and formats when writing your tally, however, you are forbidden from cutting corners and removing information/shortening the examples we provide.

### Backup Protocols

If you wish to sign up for a Scheduled Deployment as a "Backup" you MUST be available for up to 2 hours after the deployment start time, or until the deployment is finished in case you are called upon to serve. 

If at any point a participant from a Deployment is lost, a backup is to be summoned in their place to allow the deployment to remain on schedule. 

If you sign up as a backup and are called upon, but do not respond to your call to arms, then the penalties will be the same as if you didnt show up for your deployment, repeat offenders will be punished and eventually blacklisted from deploying entirely.

HOT DROPS do not have backups in our new system.
HOT DROPS are designed for heroes who are READY to dive and have an appropriate amount of time available to complete a full deployment. 

If you signup for a HOT DROP and have to leave at any point, your squad will be without a backup and will suffer.
Because of this the penalites for leaving a HOT DROP will be more severe and will include but are not limited to being blacklisted from deploying entirely.
