### Basics 
- Use a [[00 Default|template]]
- Read this Guide by SM Ain [[SPC Deployment Course]]
- take notes on the deployment you can also record the deployment but remember to let everyone now that you are doing that 
- write it in a note taking app and not in the channel itself

### Suggestions on how to Write the Tallie
- Prioritize the things you write down 
- Screenshot the load outs before the mission so its easier to remember special things 
- focus on something specific don't be to general
