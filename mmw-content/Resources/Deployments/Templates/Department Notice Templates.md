Use this as a template for posting messages into your Departure tab when you have set up a mission to host. Note: text in [] is meant to be replaced by your own text!  As we are a RP server please try to keep this in-character and also remember, if you are hosting a mission you are the leader. Try to keep some semblance of professionalism as we are RPing military members after all.
