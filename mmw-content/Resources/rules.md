## Server Rules
- Uphold and salute your Commanding Officers with unwavering respect and obedience, for they are the mighty beacons guiding our glorious crusade. Follow the chain of command diligently, as a true patriot would.

- Stay as active as a hypercharged Patriot Armor! If you're to embark on a covert mission away from the battlefield for an extended period, report your absence promptly. Remember, inactivity is akin to surrendering to the enemy and will result in assignment to the dreaded @deserter sector.

- Let freedom reign, but keep it PG-13! No hint of nudity, lewdness, or anything that might make Uncle Sam blush. Do not record anyone without their consent. We're all about spreading democracy, not indecency. And remember, even your profile picture should be as pure as the stars and stripes.

- No spamming like a malfunctioning Democracy Distributor! Use communication channels wisely and refrain from public disputes. If you've got a bone to pick, take it to the DMs, soldier.

- Our battlefield is a bastion of respect and camaraderie, not a breeding ground for toxicity or hate speech. Any behavior unbecoming of a true patriot, from targeted harassment to spreading dissent, will be met with the full force of justice.

- Impersonation is the highest form of treason! Don't even think about masquerading as another patriot, whether through words or profile pictures. Individuality is our greatest strength.

- No hawking or haggling on our hallowed grounds! This is not a marketplace; it's a sanctuary for liberty. Cheating, hacking, or any other underhanded tactics will be met with swift justice.

- Mutiny and dissent are the enemies of democracy! Any talk of revolt or undermining our Commanding Officers will be met with the most severe penalties, from demotion to expulsion from our ranks.

- Time is precious, like the last charge of a Liberty Launcher. Don't waste the valuable time of our staff with frivolous inquiries. Consult our documents and basic-info before raising a flag of concern.
 
- Loyalty is our currency! Patriots of the 101st shall not double-dip in other milsims or clans. Our allegiance lies solely with the cause of spreading democracy. Starsims and other games are exempt, for freedom knows no bounds.

Poaching is akin to betraying the very essence of democracy! Any attempt to lure away our fellow patriots will result in swift and decisive action, including expulsion from our ranks.

Alt accounts are as welcome as a communist in a fireworks factory! One patriot, one account. Let your actions be as transparent as the ideals we uphold.

Never ping something above you, like platoon company etc etc
