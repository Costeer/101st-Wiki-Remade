<h2 style="color:rgb(170, 114, 213)">Cadet</h2>
your only responsibility is to make sure to get your first training as fast as possible so you can be placed in a Squad and to become a Private

 <h2> Private </h2>
you don't really have any responsibilities just follow the rules, [[deployment-concept-overview|Join Deployments]] and have fun dying for the Battalion

<h2 style="color:rgb(103, 122, 131)">Specialist</h2> 
Specialists need to Host at least 1 deployment per Week and need to be active in The general and in the squad Chat If your Sergeant allows it you can host "Squad only Deployments"

<h2 style="color:rgb(99, 99, 99)">Corporal</h2>
Corporals are squad 2ICs, meaning they support the squad's Sergeant in leading the squad, helping them to complete their duties when they are online and taking charge when they are not. As a Corporal, you will often be the first point of contact for Troopers in your squad with requests, complaints or questions. You should be able to help them with their problem the vast majority of the time, even if this simply entails pointing them to the relevant form, document or CO. This requires an up-to-date knowledge of how the 101st functions. As such, you should keep a constant eye on the announcement and promotion channels for changes to procedures or the chain of command.

<h2 style="color:rgb(0, 176, 80)">Sergeant</h2>
Sergeants are squad ICs, meaning they are the direct leader of everyone in their squad. As a Sergeant, it will be your duty to ensure the activity and dedication of your squad by organizing Deployments regularly at a time tailored for its members. Whether these are open to members from other squads is up to you. As a rule of thumb, every squad should have one Deployment scheduled specifically for it. You will also be in charge of moderating your squad's text channel, ensuring that all messages and images adhere to the 101st rules. Like a corporal, you must be able to respond to the questions, complaints or requests of your squad members, or direct them to the relevant resources or up the chain of command if you can't give an answer yourself. 

<h2 style="color:rgb(0, 122, 55)">Sergeant Mayor</h2>
Sergeant Majors are platoon 2ICs, as well as Squad ICs, meaning they have all of the duties of a Sergeant mentioned throughout this cadre, as well as a separate set of duties specific to them. As a Sergeant Major, you should build a strong understanding of the squads, Sergeants and Corporals in your platoon, in order to liaise with them and help them to communicate with each other and with the platoon's Lieutenant. Your duties will include issuing specific tasks and targets to the Sergeants in your platoon based upon your Lieutenant's goals and them helping those Sergeants to achieve them. You must also encourage the activity of the Sergeants and Corporals in your platoon and report any inactive or incompetent COs to your Lieutenant. Finally, you must ensure that squads which are active and full or near-full have a strong Corporal to support the Sergeant in leading the squad. This is discussed more in the Standard Operating Procedures section of the cadre
