In the spirit of maintaining discipline and order, violations of our sacred code will not go unpunished. Our Commanding Officers (COs) shall mete out justice with a firm yet fair hand, employing a system of warning points commensurate with the transgression. Behold the consequences:

- 5 points: A 24-hour silence befalls you, akin to a temporary radio blackout. 
- 10 points: A 48-hour silence echoes through the ranks, a stern reminder of the gravity of your actions. 
- 15 points: A 120-hour silence ensues, casting you into the shadows of reflection, and you shall find your name etched upon the promotion blacklist. 
- 20 points: A double-edged blade of punishment strikes: a 120-hour silence, followed by a suspension spanning two days, and your name shall dwell upon the blacklist, a mark of shame. 
- 25 points: The ultimate sanction descends upon thee â€“ banishment from our ranks, forever exiled from the halls of liberty.

### After 15 Points
Upon accumulating 15 points, patriots find themselves consigned to the promotion blacklist. To redeem oneself, a rigorous path to redemption must be trodden:

- Spend 30 days in the fold of our community, proving your unwavering commitment.
- Attend 10 deployments, demonstrating your dedication to the cause.
- Garner consideration for promotion, subject to verification by a CO in consultation with High Command.
- Submit to a tribunal presided over by the esteemed BC-01 "Mind", wherein your actions shall be weighed against the scales of justice, and redemption may be earned.
