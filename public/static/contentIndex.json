{"101-Training-Program/Advanced-Movement-Mechanics":{"title":"Advanced Movement Mechanics","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Movement Speeds\nDepending on a situation, the team might be required to move at different speeds in order to move effectively as a unit. It could be used to slow down to let others catch up while still maintaining movement at all times to not be vulnerable or to speed up to catch with the others or to approach an objective much faster.\nSingle Time:\nWalking Pace by only holding the ‚ÄúW‚Äù key to initiate slow movement. Great to be used when you want to rally with another squad or team however you want to slow down to give them time to catch up to your pace or position. Can still serve other purposes however would generally be used this way.\nDouble Time:\nNormal Sprinting Pace by holding the ‚ÄúW‚Äù key and the ‚ÄúSprint‚Äù key. This will normally be used to get from A to B and will be consistent with the rest of the squad. All classes will be double time.\nTriple Time:¬†\nFast Running Pace by utilizing equipment available or utility. This is used to get to an objective as fast as possible and with as little downtime, usually used to capture an objective or to board a Pelican.\nGeneral Movement\nSituational Awareness:\nSituational Awareness is simply about knowing what is going on around you and how you can use that knowledge to survive. This training will go more in depth about types of things to be aware of however it is good to have a general idea of what it means.\nIf you want to succeed in this unit and become a better rifleman, you need to know this. It is not because of your aim or your unluckiness, it is about knowing how to survive by being cautious and knowing the hazards around you.¬†This skill can be taught but only through practice and continuous use of it. Knowing maps is part of situational awareness and can only help you succeed.\nMoving to Cover:\nAlthough it sounds¬†like a very obvious topic to cover, it is not utilized enough. Every moment, you are not in cover, you are vulnerable, no matter how secure you think you are. If you are capturing your objective for example, you can very easily get sniped on the point across the map if you are standing still exposed. You must always be aware of the path you take and utilize the most cover possible to move to it and reduce your own exposure as well as your team. Although there will not always be cover available in an open field, it is your job to find as much defilade or any natural land cover to position yourself in or to move in to cover as soon as you cross the open field.\nSpacing\nSpacing is putting distance between you and your team in order to spread out and reduce area of effect damage. The two types of spacing commonly used are: Formal and Combat Spacing.\nFormal Spacing:\nFormal Spacing is lining up either shoulder to shoulder or back to back spacing which is used to line up or stay in formations before moving into a combat zone. This is usually used to organize members into the right squad or unit.\nCombat Spacing:\nAround 5-10 meters apart will be considered combat spacing. This is used to reduce the amount of damage something does to the squad overall. A hostile grenade will be more deadly if everyone stood together in a tight knit formation rather than if everyone was spread out and it only hit one person. ¬†\nThis is especially effective against spewers. They can for example attack multiple enemies at once with their spit attack. Spreading out, shooting them from different angles, and dodging abilities will help eliminate the target. It gives you more time to do damage and less time for the Spewer to damage you.\nCompass and Mini-Map Management\nBeing able to understand how the Compass and Mini-Map work will help you in every scenario. The Compass will help in your situational awareness as it will tell you the positioning of the environment, objectives, allies, and enemies.\nIf you want to improve your calls, use your Compass to tell directions like North East, Southwest, etc.\nSquad Movement:\nNot only that but you must ensure that you are not in large clumps on the map as indicated on the Mini-Map. ¬†You want to make sure that your teammates are not in your inner circle because it is not combat spacing which means you leave you and your teammate vulnerable. If your teammate does not pay attention to their spacing, do your part and move away from them.\nLone Wolfing\nLone Wolfing is defined as someone who prepares and commits to an action alone, outside of any command structure and without material assistance from any group. If your course is moving you away from your teammates and you do not see anything on your mini-map, it means you are lone wolfing. You want to avoid this habit at all costs because you are putting your team at risk by doing so. Unless it was an organized play that you planned for with your team, lone wolfing is considered detrimental to your team and something you should not do. As the mentality check states, the mission and people first, always go with your team unless given permission to split off."},"101-Training-Program/Basic-Training-Introduction":{"title":"Basic Training Introduction","links":["101-Training-Program/Cadets-Fundamentals"],"tags":[],"content":"For use by all members of the 101st ‚ÄúHell‚Äù Battalion.

Even if you have not reached a certain objective yet, your superiors still want a clear image about what your plan is to move to an objective.\nSit-Rep Example:\nDeployment¬†Leader: ‚ÄúI need your squad to move over to the left flank of Echo and approach the point from the rear‚Äù\nFireteam Leader: ‚ÄúSeen, moving now‚Äù\nDeployment Leader: ‚ÄúGive me a sit-rep‚Äù\nFireteam Leader: ‚ÄúWe are approaching the objective now however are facing a lot of bugs on our left flank.

Every callout must follow this format however orders may have different SoPs when speaking. DO NOT¬†repeat yourself unless you feel like you weren‚Äôt heard or it is a matter or urgency. You do not want to clutter the comms.\nThe 3D‚Äôs are:\nDistance: How far a specific target is from a location. This is to better determine how close or far a target is from someone and allows for people to know where to compensate in terms of weapon or equipment. It is not always necessary however if you believe Direction is only needed for a callout.\nDirection: The specific location of a target. Use specific landmarks or objectives to make it easier to identify the location of an enemy. ¬†Calling out the target is not good enough as that information is not helpful without knowing where the target is, it is your job to make sure that gets conveyed when you see the target. Objective Markers or Key Areas on the Map will help you. Make sure your direction is specific enough to understand.\n\nDescription : The description of the target itself or the subject you are trying to point out. You can not make a callout with a direction nor without a description. An ACE report can be provided regarding the target‚Äôs health. Full Health, Half Health, Low Health.\nCallout Examples:\nThere is a Factory Strider¬†on Extraction, Far away!\nMultiple Devastators¬†contacts on my Ping.\nBile Titan 2 Rockets to the face¬†South West¬†under F3!!\nObjective¬†is all clear, no major threats, only a few Hunters¬†north of the zone.\nTank down, South East from us.\nDo Not!!!:\n‚ÄúTANK! TANK! TANK!!!‚Äù\nThe callout is being repeated and only Description is being used. It is neither clear or simple of where the target is. Only repeat if it is of immediate urgency or callout was not heard.\n‚ÄúUghhhh, Shrieker here‚Äù\nUnnecessary remarks in callout as well as not specific enough direction of target. Callout is not very important either because the target is not a priority.\n‚ÄúGot Spewer‚Äù OR ‚ÄúDead‚Äù\nNeither callout is specific enough and the second does not provide a description, distance, or direction. Where was the Spewer killed? Is the point clear now? Who is dead?\nPriority Targets:\nOn the field, not everything has to be a callout. When you want to only provide vital and precise information, it is important to know priority targets to call out in order to be the most useful in a deployment.\nLandmarks:\nLandmarks are an important location because if they are not on a certain objective, it will be harder to track a certain target. You may utilize command landmarks on maps that are universally understood to better specify your callouts.\nRadio Discipline:\nRadio Discipline is utilized to decrease the amount of excessive and pointless chatter on the comms side of a deployment. When there are 4 people in a deployment and everyone is talking pointlessly, there will be a lot of radio traffic on the comms especially when someone is trying to give orders. When not talking about callouts or planning attacks, the person should be quiet to maintain clear communication.\nAs a troop unit on the field, not all callouts will apply to you if that be due to distance or vicinity. It is your job to be able to distinguish what callout or orders are important to you, which one to follow, and which one to ignore. They will not always call you out by name or unit so it is important you understand how it works.\nOrder Acknowledgement:\nIf you are receiving an order, make sure to comply to your superior to notify with them that you comply with the order:\nSeen/Copy - say one of these to show you understand what is being said.\nClear Comms\n‚ÄúClear Comms‚Äù is something you say when there is traffic in the comms and you need to relay a message of urgency and can be repeated 3 times. When you call out with a loud tone: ‚ÄúClear Comms‚Äù it is a signal to everyone in the voice chat to lock it up and be quiet so they can hear your transmission. This can also be used when the deployment leader requires everyone‚Äôs attention however too many people are talking at once. When you hear ‚ÄúClear Comms‚Äù, you must be quiet even if you were in the middle of making a callout.\nNext Advanced Movement Mechanics"},"101-Training-Program/Deployment-Concept-Overview":{"title":"Deployment Concept Overview","links":["Resources/Deployments/Deployments-explained","101-Training-Program/Communications-Fundamentals"],"tags":[],"content":"Deployment¬†Premise\nWhen it comes to deployments, we‚Äôre talking about the pinnacle of organized play, where the bonds of brotherhood are forged in the fires of teamwork!

Just make sure to write them up in the Tallies Channel on the Discord.\n\n\nFailure to use your assigned class during deployment may result in sanctions, so stay true to your role!\n\n\nImagine yourself as a Deployment Leader, while being a soldier do not behave in a manner you wouldn‚Äôt like your soldiers to behave in. Treat others the way you want to be treated!\n\n\nLet these rules guide you as we march forward, united in purpose and steadfast in our resolve to crush tyranny beneath our collective boot!\nFollowing Leadership\nWithin our ranks, every troop is a vital cog in the machinery of freedom, bound by duty and honor to heed the commands of their superiors. It is not merely a responsibility, but a sacred obligation, to rally alongside our brothers-in-arms and march forward as one cohesive force. Together, we strive tirelessly towards a common goal, driven by the noble ideals of liberty and justice for all. Let the spirit of camaraderie and unity guide our every step, for in our unity lies the strength to overcome any obstacle and emerge victorious on the battlefield of freedom!\nDebriefings\nAfter the dust settles and victory or defeat hangs heavy in the air, the deployment leader takes charge once more, guiding the unit into a hallowed ritual known as the debriefing phase. This is not merely a procedural formality; it is a cornerstone of our collective ethos, reminiscent of the democratic ideals upon which our Super Earth was founded. As the stars and stripes wave proudly overhead, we gather as equals, from the most seasoned veterans to the freshest recruits, to engage in a profound reflection on our shared journey.\nWith precision, each member of the unit contributes their insights and observations.. Here, there is no rank nor file; only the common bond of service to a cause greater than ourselves. Troopers and cadets, emboldened by the spirit of liberty, speak freely, unafraid to voice concerns or criticisms of their superiors should they arise. For it is in this sacred space of dialogue and camaraderie that the seeds of improvement are sown, nourished by the fertile soil of mutual respect and understanding.\nThe deployment leader compiles a detailed report in the deployment-tallies channel, often including screenshots or Recordings to illuminate the end result. This report fosters transparency and accountability, guiding our unit forward with lessons learned. In these digital records, our camaraderie and spirit endure, resilient in the face of adversity.\nMore Information on how to attend Deployments: Deployments explained\nNext Communications Fundamentals"},"101-Training-Program/Newbie-Overview":{"title":"Newbie Overview","links":["101-Training-Program/Basic-Training-Introduction","Chanel-Overview"],"tags":[],"content":"Welcome to the Server!\nif you haven‚Äôt doe so already you should read the Basic Training Introduction as it covers most of the important things to know after that you cane come back here!\nChannel Overview\nSometimes the amount of channels on this server can be a bit overwhelming so you can find an overview of most of the channels on the server in this wiki"},"101-Training-Program/Old-Training-Programm/Formations":{"title":"Formations","links":["Chanel-Overview"],"tags":[],"content":"General Information\nRegardless of the specific formation, troopers should be comfortable rolling and moving around to avoid grenades and enemy fire. The formations are flexible guidelines to encourage troopers to remain in roughly the correct area, not stringent templates to be followed to the letter. Troopers should adapt these guidelines to the context of the situation and terrain using their own initiative.\nRegroup\n‚ÄúRegroup at [position]‚Äù\nTroopers should drop whatever they are doing and move as fast as possible to the designated regroup position. Once there, they should form an All-Round Defense (ARD), as shown below, ensuring they remain in cover where possible. Supports and COs may remain in the center of the ARD in order to coordinate the team or provide medical assistance to injured troopers.\n\nBaseline\n‚ÄúBaseline‚Äù or ‚ÄúBaseline at [position]‚Äù\nTroopers should form a line a) on either side of the CO or b) at the specified position. They should attempt to crouch in cover and ensure they have around 5m between them and the next trooper along. This ensures that any grenades thrown at the baseline will not kill more than one trooper at a time.\n\nOnce in a baseline, the commands ‚ÄúPush‚Äù and ‚ÄúWithdraw‚Äù may be used to move the baseline forwards and backwards respectively. When told to ‚ÄúPush‚Äù, troopers should move out of cover and begin to sprint forwards, maintaining their 5m spacings where possible. When told to ‚ÄúWithdraw‚Äù, troopers should walk slowly backwards while firing forwards continually to provide covering fire. Should an officer class utilizing the squad shield be present during the withdrawal, they should place the shield down to block shots whilst the rest of the unit makes a more hasty retreat.\nArrowhead\n‚ÄúArrowhead on me‚Äù or ‚ÄúArrowhead on [Trooper].‚Äù\nTroopers should form an arrowhead shape (as shown below) with a) the CO or b) the specified trooper at the front. Then, they will be told to move to a given position, normally a command post. While moving to said position, they should sprint forwards, following the terrain and firing at any enemies they encounter. Troopers should keep in mind that they may be asked to throw grenades or utilize other abilities upon reaching the position that they are attacking.\n\nWhile moving in an arrowhead formation, a team may come across a corridor, cave or other passageway too narrow for the arrowhead to fit through. If this occurs, troopers should squeeze into the center of the formation as shown below.\n\nDefend Doorway\n‚Äú[Trooper] and [Trooper], defend [doorway]‚Äù\nThe specified troopers should crouch on either side of the doorway, ensuring that they use the door frame as cover. They should look through the doorway diagonally so that they can nevertheless cover all angles.\n\nBreach Doorway\n‚Äú[Trooper] and [Trooper], breach [doorway]‚Äù\nThe specified troopers should decide between themselves which will act as the ‚Äòsupport‚Äô and the ‚Äòpointman‚Äô. In the diagrams below, the pointman starts on the left and the supportstarts on the right. The pointman should remain pressed against the wall but move away from the doorway, while the support should move away from the wall, as shown in step 1.\nOnce the troopers are in position, the CO will say the word ‚ÄúBreach‚Äù. At this point, the support should throw a grenade diagonally into the doorway such that it bounces into the center of the corridor or room beyond, as shown in step 2.\nWhen said grenade explodes, the pointman then begins step 3, as they jump into the doorway and begin to fire at any enemy contacts while assessing the situation. This is the reason that they moved away from the doorway during step 1, as it prevents them from overshooting the doorway. Cases where it is not possible to move far enough to the left to avoid overshooting are discussed further down.\nOnce the pointman has assessed the situation they then commence step 4. Here, if there is a reasonable number of enemies defending the doorway, they should follow the green arrows, pushing through the doorway while the support follows them up. Otherwise, they should follow the red arrow, doging back into the cover of the doorframe.\n\nIn the case that it is not possible for the pointman to move far enough to avoid overshooting the doorway, for example because they are breaching out of a corridor, they should follow the alternative steps below. These are similar to the above steps, however the pointman simply walks into the doorway instead of jumping.\n\nClear Corner\n‚Äú[Trooper] and [Trooper], clear [corner]‚Äù\nThis command is an alternative to the Breach Doorway command for use with corners, the main distinction being that the support begins on the same side as the pointman.\n\nWant to learn more about the channels in the Server?\nChanel Overview"},"101-Training-Program/Old-Training-Programm/Section-1":{"title":"Section 1","links":["101-Training-Program/Old-Training-Programm/Section-2"],"tags":[],"content":"Cadet Fundamentals\nWelcome to the 101st!\n\n\nWelcome to our Helldivers 2 MilSim Community, where the pursuit of fun and lore intertwines with the spread of democracy like fireworks on the Fourth of July!

But beware, for in this digital battlefield, the chain of command may shift like the winds of liberty. Whether you‚Äôre following the orders of a seasoned sergeant or a fresh-faced lieutenant, one thing remains constant: obedience is the name of the game.\nAs you load into the fray alongside your comrades, the deployment leader holds the keys to victory. Prepare yourselves for the call to arms, whether it be tactical communication fit for a war room or casual banter befitting a gathering of patriots at the local watering hole. Flexibility is our greatest asset on the battlefield, after all!\nSo remember, when the deployment leader speaks, listen closely and follow their lead. For in the chaos of war, it‚Äôs the unity of purpose that will carry us to victory!\nScheduling a deployment\nIn the hallowed halls of our battalion, the process of scheduling a deployment is as sacred as the stripes on Old Glory! If you find yourself in the esteemed position of Commanding Officer, you wield the power to orchestrate missions that‚Äôll make even George Washington‚Äôs wooden teeth chatter with excitement.\nBut hold your horses, soldier! Before you charge into battle, remember this: deployments must be scheduled at least 4 hours in advance, ensuring every brave soul has an equal shot at joining the fray. Fairness, after all, is the cornerstone of democracy!\nNow, should your deployment garner enough eager volunteers to fill every spot, it‚Äôs your duty to rally the troops! Ping the signed-up soldiers in the Helldive-departures\nchannel 2 hours and 15 minutes before the mission, reminding them of their sacred duty to defend freedom.\nAnd for those ambitious enough to host repeated deployments, seek approval from your superiors to be immortalized in the üìÜ‚îÇdeployment-schedule channel. Remember, with great power comes great responsibility!\nTo kickstart the deployment process, simply type:\n/event create [title] [time-start]\nFor instance:\n/event create Deployment 2024-03-26 20:00\nBut heed this warning, comrades: only one class per deployment is permitted. Let‚Äôs keep the battlefield balanced, shall we?\nOnce the dust settles, don‚Äôt forget to document your heroic deeds in the üìã‚îÇdeployment-tallies channel. For in the annals of history, it‚Äôs the written word that immortalizes the deeds of patriots!\nDeployment Rules\nAs we embark on our noble quest for victory, let‚Äôs not forget the rules of engagement that govern our actions on the battlefield. Respect, discipline, and adherence to protocol are the cornerstones of our mission, so pay heed to the following directives:\n\n\nShow utmost respect to our esteemed Deployment Leader and obey their every decree. Their word is law on the battlefield!\n\n\nKeep communication clear and concise; no shouting down the mic like a banshee in battle!\n\n\nA deployment counts as successful only if and when a whole ‚Äúoperation‚Äù has been finished. But do not fear! Even failed deployments count towards your attendance numbers and as long as we can learn from them, they make us even stronger! Just make sure to write them up intallies\n\n\nEach soldier must stick to their chosen class like glue, wielding their weapon of choice with pride. Only those who have earned the right may wield advanced classes or vehicles, but feel free to customize your loadout with 1 stratagem of your choice, unless instructed otherwise.\n\n\nFailure to use your assigned class during deployment may result in sanctions, so stay true to your role!\n\n\nImagine yourself as a Deployment Leader, while being a soldier do not behave in a manner you wouldn‚Äôt like your soldiers to behave in. Treat others the way you want to be treated!\n\n\nLet these rules guide you as we march forward, united in purpose and steadfast in our resolve to crush tyranny beneath our collective boot!\nJoining a Deployment\nA 101st Deployment can only be attended by members of the rank of ¬†Private and higher. Deployments can range from a fireteam to a company order wide deployment.\nTo join a deployment you must do the following:\n\n\nHead over to your platoon‚Äôs deployment-request channel and with a simple click, sign up for your desired role. Let your commitment to the cause shine bright like the stars on our flag!\n\n\nOn the day of reckoning, ensure you join the battlefield with the punctuality of a minuteman at Lexington. Failure to arrive promptly may result in being left behind, so don‚Äôt dawdle!\n\n\nTake the initiative and add the deployment leader as a friend if you haven‚Äôt already done so. When the call to arms is sounded, request an invitation to the group with the urgency of a messenger bearing news from the front lines.\n\n\nOnce the troops are assembled and ready for action, the deployment leader will seize the moment to outline the rules of engagement. Pay attention, soldiers, for knowledge is power on the battlefield!\n\n\nWith these steps etched in your mind like the stripes on our nation‚Äôs flag, you‚Äôre ready to march into battle with the confidence of a true patriot. Onward, to victory!\nClasses\nTo be written, refer to¬†101st Classes Information ¬†document\nFollowing Leadership\nWithin our ranks, every troop is a vital cog in the machinery of freedom, bound by duty and honor to heed the commands of their superiors. It is not merely a responsibility, but a sacred obligation, to rally alongside our brothers-in-arms and march forward as one cohesive force. Together, we strive tirelessly towards a common goal, driven by the noble ideals of liberty and justice for all. Let the spirit of camaraderie and unity guide our every step, for in our unity lies the strength to overcome any obstacle and emerge victorious on the battlefield of freedom!\nDebriefings\nAfter the dust settles and victory or defeat hangs heavy in the air, the deployment leader takes charge once more, guiding the unit into a hallowed ritual known as the debriefing phase. This is not merely a procedural formality; it is a cornerstone of our collective ethos, reminiscent of the democratic ideals upon which our Super Earth was founded. As the stars and stripes wave proudly overhead, we gather as equals, from the most seasoned veterans to the freshest recruits, to engage in a profound reflection on our shared journey.\nWith precision, each member of the unit contributes their insights and observations.. Here, there is no rank nor file; only the common bond of service to a cause greater than ourselves. Troopers and cadets, emboldened by the spirit of liberty, speak freely, unafraid to voice concerns or criticisms of their superiors should they arise. For it is in this sacred space of dialogue and camaraderie that the seeds of improvement are sown, nourished by the fertile soil of mutual respect and understanding.\nThe deployment leader compiles a detailed report in the deployment-tallies channel, including screenshots to illuminate the end result. This report fosters transparency and accountability, guiding our unit forward with lessons learned. In these digital records, our camaraderie and spirit endure, resilient in the face of adversity.\nNext Section"},"101-Training-Program/Old-Training-Programm/Section-3":{"title":"Section 3","links":["101-Training-Program/Old-Training-Programm/Section-2","101-Training-Program/Old-Training-Programm/Section-4"],"tags":[],"content":"Communication Fundamentals\nback to Section 2\nSituation Reports\nWhen someone requests a Situation Report or Sit-Rep, they want to know how the situation is going or being handled. Even if you have not reached a certain objective yet, your superiors still want a clear image about what your plan is to move to an objective.\nSit-Rep Example:\nDeployment¬†Leader: ‚ÄúI need your squad to move over to the left flank of Echo and approach the point from the rear‚Äù\nFireteam Leader: ‚ÄúSeen, moving now‚Äù\nDeployment Leader: ‚ÄúGive me a sit-rep‚Äù\nFireteam Leader: ‚ÄúWe are approaching the objective now however are facing a lot of bugs on our left flank. Will be able to move to the rear position in a few minutes‚Äù\n3D‚Äôs of Callouts\nIt is vital that if you want information conveyed clearly and thoroughly, you need to have an understanding of the 3D‚Äôs of callouts or some variation of the 3. Every callout must follow this format however orders may have different SoPs when speaking. DO NOT¬†repeat yourself unless you feel like you weren‚Äôt heard or it is a matter or urgency. You do not want to clutter the comms.\nThe 3D‚Äôs are:\nDistance: How far a specific target is from a location. This is to better determine how close or far a target is from someone and allows for people to know where to compensate in terms of weapon or equipment. It is not always necessary however if you believe Direction is only needed for a callout.\nDirection: The specific location of a target. Use specific landmarks or objectives to make it easier to identify the location of an enemy. ¬†Calling out the target is not good enough as that information is not helpful without knowing where the target is, it is your job to make sure that gets conveyed when you see the target. Objective Markers or Key Areas on the Map will help you. Make sure your direction is specific enough to understand.\n\nDescription : The description of the target itself or the subject you are trying to point out. You can not make a callout with a direction nor without a description. An ACE report can be provided regarding the target‚Äôs health. Full Health, Half Health, Low Health.\nCallout Examples:\nThere is a Bile Titan¬†on Extraction, across the map!\nMultiple B1 and B2¬†contacts on Echo point.\nTank¬†is low on health¬†near caves¬†under Charlie!!\nEcho¬†is all clear, no major threats, only 2 Stalkers¬†north of the zone.\nI killed the Tank, who was located South East from us.\nDo Not!!!:\n‚ÄúTANK! TANK! TANK!!!‚Äù\nThe callout is being repeated and only Description is being used. It is neither clear or simple of where the target is. Only repeat if it is of immediate urgency or callout was not heard.\n‚ÄúUghhhh, Shrieker here‚Äù\nUnnecessary remarks in callout as well as not specific enough direction of target. Callout is not very important either because the target is not a priority.\n‚ÄúGot Spewer‚Äù OR ‚ÄúDead‚Äù\nNeither callout is specific enough and the second does not provide a description, distance, or direction. Where was the Spewer killed? Is the point clear now? Who is dead?\nPriority Targets:\nOn the field, not everything has to be a callout. When you want to only provide vital and precise information, it is important to know priority targets to call out in order to be the most useful in a deployment. Targets will be given a priority list to show what you should or should not focus on calling out to your team.\nLandmarks:\nLandmarks are an important location because if they are not on a certain objective, it will be harder to track a certain target. You may utilize command landmarks on maps that are universally understood to better specify your callouts.\nRadio Discipline:\nRadio Discipline is utilized to decrease the amount of excessive and pointless chatter on the comms side of a deployment. When there could potentially be 4 people in a deployment and everyone is talking pointlessly, there will be a lot of radio traffic on the comms especially when someone is trying to give orders. When not talking about callouts or planning attacks, the person should be quiet to maintain clear communication.\nAs a troop unit on the field, not all callouts will apply to you if that be due to distance or vicinity. It is your job to be able to distinguish what callout or orders are important to you, which one to follow, and which one to ignore. They will not always call you out by name or unit so it is important you understand how it works.\nOrder Acknowledgement:\nIf you are receiving an order, make sure to comply to your superior to notify with them that you comply with the order:\nSeen/Copy - say one of these to show you understand what is being said.\nClear Comms\n‚ÄúClear Comms‚Äù is something you say when there is traffic in the comms and you need to relay a message of urgency and can be repeated 3 times. When you call out with a loud tone: ‚ÄúClear Comms‚Äù it is a signal to everyone in the voice chat to lock it up and be quiet so they can hear your transmission. This can also be used when the deployment leader requires everyone‚Äôs attention however too many people are talking at once. When you hear ‚ÄúClear Comms‚Äù, you must be quiet even if you were in the middle of making a callout.\nNext Section"},"101-Training-Program/Old-Training-Programm/Section-4":{"title":"Section 4","links":["101-Training-Program/Old-Training-Programm/Section-5"],"tags":[],"content":"Advanced Movement Mechanics\nMovement Speeds\nDepending on a situation, the team might be required to move at different speeds in order to move effectively as a unit. It could be used to slow down to let others catch up while still maintaining movement at all times to not be vulnerable or to speed up to catch with the others or to approach an objective much faster.\nSingle Time:\nWalking Pace by only holding the ‚ÄúW‚Äù key to initiate slow movement. Great to be used when you want to rally with another squad or team however you want to slow down to give them time to catch up to your pace or position. Can still serve other purposes however would generally be used this way.\nDouble Time:\nNormal Sprinting Pace by holding the ‚ÄúW‚Äù key and the ‚ÄúSprint‚Äù key. This will normally be used to get from A to B and will be consistent with the rest of the squad. All classes will be double time.\nTriple Time:¬†\nFast Running Pace by utilizing equipment available or utility. This is used to get to an objective as fast as possible and with as little downtime, usually used to capture an objective or to board a dropship. Specialists have the ability to increase their speed even more by running with jetpacks.\nGeneral Movement\nSituational Awareness:\nSituational Awareness is simply about knowing what is going on around you and how you can use that knowledge to survive. This training will go more in depth about types of things to be aware of however it is good to have a general idea of what it means.\nIf you want to succeed in this unit and become a better rifleman, you need to know this. It is not because of your aim or your unluckiness, it is about knowing how to survive by being cautious and knowing the hazards around you.¬†This skill can not be taught but only through practice and continuous use of it. Knowing maps is part of situational awareness and can only help you succeed.\nMoving to Cover:\nAlthough it sounds¬†like a very obvious topic to cover, it is not utilized enough. Every moment, you are not in cover, you are vulnerable, no matter how secure you think you are. If you are capturing your objective for example, you can very easily get sniped on the point across the map if you are standing still exposed. You must always be aware of the path you take and utilize the most cover possible to move to it and reduce your own exposure as well as your team. Although there will not always be cover available in an open field, it is your job to find as much defilade or any natural land cover to position yourself in or to move in to cover as soon as you cross the open field.\nSpacing\nSpacing is putting distance between you and your team in order to spread out and reduce area of effect damage. The two types of spacing commonly used are: Formal and Combat Spacing.\nFormal Spacing:\nFormal Spacing is lining up either shoulder to shoulder or back to back spacing which is used to line up or stay in formations before moving into a combat zone. This is usually used to organize members into the right squad or unit.\nCombat Spacing:\nAround 5-10 meters apart will be considered combat spacing. This is used to reduce the amount of damage something does to the squad overall. A hostile grenade will be more deadly if everyone stood together in a tight knit formation rather than if everyone was spread out and it only hit one person. ¬†\nThis is especially effective against spewers. They can for example attack multiple enemies at once with his spit attack. Spreading out, shooting him from different angles, and dodging abilities will help eliminate the target. It gives you more time to do damage and less time for the Spewer to damage you.\nSpawns and Locations\nAcknowledging the controlled nature of the squad system in Helldivers II, where teammates are intentionally assigned, spawn points will now be regulated exclusively through captured objectives or designated ‚ÄúReinforce‚Äù locations. This deliberate approach ensures strategic cohesion, reinforcing our tactical advantage on the battlefield.\nSquad Spawn Concept:\nA fireteam effort requires the attention of all four people. Missing a person can result in doing more damage than good in the end which means that there will be a lot of rallying and regrouping. Every person that dies in combat is a member of the fireteam that could‚Äôve been there to help support the objective. If you die , let your commanding officer know and wait for their instructions. If this isn‚Äôt possible, wait for a respawn patiently and keep the comms clear.\nRadar Management\nBeing able to understand how the radar works will help you in every scenario. The Radar will help in your situational awareness as it will tell you the positioning of the environment, objectives, allies, and enemies.\nThe Radar also gives you North and South although it blends in with the environment. If you want to improve your calls, use your radar to tell compass directions like North East, Southwest, etc.\nSquad Movement:\nNot only that but you must ensure that you are not in large clumps on the map as indicated on the radar. ¬†You want to make sure that your teammates are not in your inner circle because it is not combat spacing which means you leave you and your teammate vulnerable. If your teammate does not pay attention to their spacing, do your part and move away from them.\nLone Wolfing\nLone Wolfing is defined as someone who prepares and commits to an action alone, outside of any command structure and without material assistance from any group. If your radar is moving away from your teammates and you do not see anything on your mini-map, it means you are lone wolfing. You want to avoid this habit at all costs because you are putting your team at risk by doing so. Unless it was an organized play that you planned for with your team, lone wolfing is considered detrimental to your team and something you should not do. As the mentality check states, the mission and people first, always go with your team unless given permission to split off.\nNext Section"},"101-Training-Program/Old-Training-Programm/Section-5":{"title":"Section 5","links":["Chanel-Overview"],"tags":[],"content":"Formations\nGeneral Information\nRegardless of the specific formation, troopers should be comfortable rolling and moving around to avoid grenades and enemy fire. The formations are flexible guidelines to encourage troopers to remain in roughly the correct area, not stringent templates to be followed to the letter. Troopers should adapt these guidelines to the context of the situation and terrain using their own initiative.\nSome of the formations make exceptions for specific classes. These exceptions only apply at the behest of the squad CO.\nRegroup\n‚ÄúRegroup at [position]‚Äù\nTroopers should drop whatever they are doing and move as fast as possible to the designated regroup position. Once there, they should form an All-Round Defense (ARD), as shown below, ensuring they remain in cover where possible. Supports and COs may remain in the center of the ARD in order to coordinate the team or provide medical assistance to injured troopers.\n\nBaseline\n‚ÄúBaseline‚Äù or ‚ÄúBaseline at [position]‚Äù\nTroopers should form a line a) on either side of the CO or b) at the specified position. They should attempt to crouch in cover and ensure they have around 5m between them and the next trooper along (the inner circle on the RADAR). This ensures that any grenades thrown at the baseline will not kill more than one trooper at a time. Medics, Specialists and COs may remain behind the baseline.\n\nOnce in a baseline, the commands ‚ÄúPush‚Äù and ‚ÄúWithdraw‚Äù may be used to move the baseline forwards and backwards respectively. When told to ‚ÄúPush‚Äù, troopers should move out of cover and begin to sprint forwards, maintaining their 5m spacings where possible. When told to ‚ÄúWithdraw‚Äù, troopers should walk slowly backwards while firing forwards continually to provide covering fire. Should an officer class utilizing the squad shield be present during the withdrawal, they should place the shield down to block shots whilst the rest of the unit makes a more hasty retreat.\nArrowhead\n‚ÄúArrowhead on me‚Äù or ‚ÄúArrowhead on [Trooper].‚Äù\nTroopers should form an arrowhead shape (as shown below) with a) the CO or b) the specified trooper at the front. Then, they will be told to move to a given position, normally a command post. While moving to said position, they should sprint forwards, following the terrain and firing at any enemies they encounter. Troopers should keep in mind that they may be asked to throw grenades or utilize other abilities upon reaching the position that they are attacking.\n\nWhile moving in an arrowhead formation, a team may come across a corridor, cave or other passageway too narrow for the arrowhead to fit through. If this occurs, troopers should squeeze into the center of the formation as shown below.\n\nDefend Doorway\n‚Äú[Trooper] and [Trooper], defend [doorway]‚Äù\nThe specified troopers should crouch on either side of the doorway, ensuring that they use the door frame as cover. They should look through the doorway diagonally so that they can nevertheless cover all angles.\n\nBreach Doorway\n‚Äú[Trooper] and [Trooper], breach [doorway]‚Äù\nThe specified troopers should decide between themselves which will act as the ‚Äòsupport‚Äô and the ‚Äòpointman‚Äô. In the diagrams below, the pointman starts on the left and the supportstarts on the right. The pointman should remain pressed against the wall but move away from the doorway, while the support should move away from the wall, as shown in step 1. They should then activate any abilities they need.\nOnce the troopers are in position, the CO will say the word ‚ÄúBreach‚Äù. At this point, the support should throw a grenade diagonally into the doorway such that it bounces into the center of the corridor or room beyond, as shown in step 2. All Base Classes have access to a grenade that can bounce in this way.\nWhen said grenade explodes, the pointman then begins step 3, as they roll across into the doorway and begin to fire at any enemy contacts while assessing the situation. This is the reason that they moved away from the doorway during step 1, as it prevents them from overshooting the doorway. Cases where it is not possible to move far enough to the left to avoid overshooting are discussed further down.\nOnce the pointman has assessed the situation they then commence step 4. Here, if there is a reasonable number of enemies defending the doorway, they should follow the green arrows, pushing through the doorway while the support follows them up. Otherwise, they should follow the red arrow, rolling back into the cover of the doorframe.\n\nIn the case that it is not possible for the pointman to move far enough to avoid overshooting the doorway, for example because they are breaching out of a corridor, they should follow the alternative steps below. These are similar to the above steps, however the pointman simply walks into the doorway instead of rolling.\n\nClear Corner\n‚Äú[Trooper] and [Trooper], clear [corner]‚Äù\nThis command is an alternative to the Breach Doorway command for use with corners, the main distinction being that the support begins on the same side as the pointman.\n\nWant to learn more about the channels in the Server?\nChanel Overview"},"Chanel-Overview":{"title":"Chanel Overview","links":["Resources/Medals","Resources/Deployments/Deployments-explained"],"tags":[],"content":"\nServer Stats\n\nNot technically channels just there for looks\n\nOnbording Stuff\n\nEverything except for sanctions is a one time read and you don‚Äôt have to really pay attention to these\n\nThis is where sanctions for people that misbehave are posted if you get pinged here good luck\n\nThis channel is where server booster messages are posted\n\nH.E.A.T.\n\nUnder Construction\n\nTech Department\n\nThis is where technical things about the game like strategies and server tech stuff gets posted and discussed\n\nThe Battalion\n\nThe ‚Äúgalactic war status‚Äù channel contains an updating message that displays the current status of the war like mayor orders\nThis is what it looks like:\n\n\nWar updates is a record of the events that happend in-game like libarating a planet\n\n\nGame updates logs the announcements made in the official discord\n\n\n\nBattalion structure and resources are channels where you can learn about the battalion same as the wiki (hi :3)\nHistory and lore is where you can read up on the lore of the server we also have these here\n\n\nIn announcements important things that happen in the server are posted\n\n\nIn medals and promotion you get notified if you get a promotion or a medal\nto learn what you need to do to get a medal click here\n\n\nThese channels are pretty self explanatory but hub is your general chat while picks clips and memes are more ‚Äúspecialized‚Äù\n\n\nThis is where you can request a helmet if you are a Sargent or if you aren‚Äôt check the pinned messages to see the premade helmets\n\n\nLOA request is where you write a message to let the people in the server now if you are unavailable PLEASE ONLY MAKE A LOA REQUEST IF YOU WILL BE GONE FOR MORE THAN 5 DAYS\n\n\nThe suggestions channel is where you can make suggestions about the server and have them rejected by high command\nThe bot commands channel is where you use the bots on the server\n\nVoice Channels\n\nThis is where you can talk to your fellow helldivers and enjoy there company\nLFG channels are for playing casual matches that don‚Äôt award any points and also typically involve less roleplay\n\nDeployments\n\nLook here for an explanation Deployments explained\n\nCompany Platoon and Squad chat\n\nThese channels will vary based on what Company/Platoon/Squad you are in but they follow the same basic layout.\nThe channel with your squad name (here deceptive-harlequins) is a channel where only the members of your own squad can see your messages\nThe platoon hub is only for members of your platoon and the company hub is for members of your company\nThe company order channel is for small announcements that concern mostly just your company\nThe company structure channel is used to display the company structure"},"Personnel-Files/Personnel-File-BM-02-Steroid":{"title":"Personnel File BM-02 Steroid","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"\n101st ‚ÄúHell‚Äù Battalion\nMilitary Personnel File\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCodename: BM-02 SteroidName: ¬†‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñàRank: Battalion MajorDOB: ‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñàWith the permission of Super Earth HighCommand, Battalion Major Steroid has been granteda processed version of E-710 for medical and recreational purposes.\nDuties:\nServes as Second in Command of Freeze company within the battalion, assisting captain Freeze in command responsibilities.

Intelligence reports indicated possible survivors trapped in the area, necessitating an immediate Helldiver intervention to locate and rescue any civilians and assess ongoing threats.\nLog:\nDeployment at dawn, with the team fully equipped for urban search and rescue under potentially hostile conditions.\nInitial assessment revealed extensive damage; several residential blocks were demolished, with fires still burning in some areas.\nAt 0530 hrs, amidst the wreckage of what was once a housing complex, Corporal Jenkins detected a faint heat signature.\nInvestigation led to the discovery of a young boy beneath the rubble, identified as Jacob Jenssen. The child was in shock, showing signs of emotional distress and physical injuries.\nImmediate first aid was administered, and the child was comforted by Specialist Tara Lee, who has training in psychology.\nThe team secured the perimeter, confirming no immediate Automaton threat in the vicinity.\nArrived at the designated safe zone at 0630 hrs, where the child was transferred to SEAF foot soldiers\nOutcome:\nMission successful with the rescue of one child survivor. The area was secured, and no Automaton threats were encountered during extraction. The survivor is under medical care and will receive ongoing psychological support due to potential trauma.\nLeader‚Äôs Notes:\nThe squad performed very well, exactly as trained. I can‚Äôt help but feel sorry for the young boy we rescued. He probably lost his entire family to these heartless monsters. The squad is worried that the boy might have nowhere to go.\nAddition 1:\nA few weeks after the deployment, the medical department contacted us and informed us that the boy had fully healed up but had nowhere to go. He would have to go into foster care on another Planet. After a long discussion with all of my squad members, we decided to adopt the boy and take him with us. He will be living on the super destroyer and we are currently waiting for him to be transferred.\nAddition 2:\nThe boy has been on the ship for a few days now but has not spoken a single word with any of us, except for Tara. He opened up to her about what he saw that day and broke down right after. He wept uncontrollably for a few hours while the squad tried to comfort him by any means possible. He‚Äôs asleep now in a makeshift room we set up for him. I really hope he gets better with time.\nAddition 3:\nAfter a few sessions with his psychiatrist, the boy seems to be in a better mood now. He started helping around on the ship and has been talking to all of us. We are very relieved that he is doing better. He tried carrying an Autocannon the other day all by himself and promptly dropped it on the floor. Ryan started calling him ‚ÄúSteroid‚Äù after that and the name stuck with him.¬†\nAddition 4:\nSteroid talked to me and said that he wants to become a helldiver, like us. I tried to tell him otherwise but he insisted. He really wants to and brought it up multiple times to the entire squad. I have talked with my higher ups and managed to organize a personal trainer for him to surprise him with his first training session tomorrow. I do have a few concerns about him starting such intensive training at his young age, but the boy has already seen things nobody should ever see in their lives and as far as I‚Äôve noticed, he seems very capable.\n\nAddendum 2:¬†\nPsychological development report of Jacob Jensen\n‚Äî ‚Äî ‚Äî ‚Äî ‚Äî ‚Äî ‚Äî ‚Äî ‚Äî ‚Äî ‚Äî ‚Äî ‚Äî ‚Äî ‚Äî ‚Äî ‚Äî ‚Äî ‚Äî ‚Äî ‚Äî ‚Äî ‚Äî ‚Äî ‚Äî ‚Äî ‚Äî ‚Äî ‚Äî ‚Äî ‚Äî ‚Äî ‚Äî ‚Äî\nSubject: ‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà ‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà ¬†aka ‚ÄúSteroid‚Äù\nDate of Birth: [REDACTED]\nPsychiatrist: Dr. Lisa Grant\nInstitution: SEAF Operational Support Unit\nReport Date: [DATA EXPUNGED]\nIntroduction:\nThis report summarizes the psychological development of ‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà , also called ‚ÄúSteroid‚Äù, a young boy who was rescued by Helldiver squad Alpha Recon 6 during a mission in sector 47-B on [REDACTED] following an Automaton attack. Since his rescue, he has been adopted by his rescuers and resides on the super destroyer SES ‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà, periodically leaving for his helldiver training in the Sol system. The following logs reflect his adaptation to his new environment and his psychological growth from a trauma survivor to a Helldiver trainee.\nSession Logs\nSession 1: Week 1 of therapy\nExhibited symptoms of acute stress reaction, characterized by detachment and sporadic periods of hyper-alertness. The initial assessment showed a high level of resilience despite significant trauma. After being informed about his adoption by Alpha Recon 6, his symptoms seemed to improve slightly.\nSession 5: Week 5 of Therapy\nBegan to form attachments with members of the squad, particularly Specialist Tara Lee, who has taken a maternal role. He showed initial interest in the daily routines of the squad, asking numerous questions about the duties of a Helldiver. His mood appeared more stable, with increasing periods of contentment and curiosity.\nSession 12: Week 14 of Therapy\nEnrolled in the Helldiver training program with a personal trainer before moving onto bootcamp and simulated missions. Has shown remarkable adaptability and eagerness to learn. His physical coordination and endurance have improved significantly. Socially, he is much more engaged and has started forming deeper relationships with peers and instructors.\nSession 20: Week 23 of Therapy\nConfidence has grown immensely; often volunteers for tasks during training sessions. His instructors report that he shows a natural aptitude for strategic thinking and combat training. Psychologically, he appears to have found a sense of belonging and purpose, which has greatly contributed to his overall happiness and well-being.\nSession 38: Week 51 of Therapy\nAs Steroid approaches the one-year mark of his adoption into the Helldiver squad, he has blossomed into an outgoing, enthusiastic young trainee. His resilience has transformed into a leadership trait, often seen helping newer trainees. His psychological profile indicates a significant decrease in trauma-related symptoms, replaced by a strong sense of identity and community.\nEnd of Therapy\n\nAddendum 3:\nTraining Progress Report of ‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà\n‚Äî ‚Äî ‚Äî ‚Äî ‚Äî ‚Äî ‚Äî ‚Äî ‚Äî ‚Äî ‚Äî ‚Äî ‚Äî ‚Äî ‚Äî ‚Äî ‚Äî ‚Äî ‚Äî ‚Äî ‚Äî ‚Äî ‚Äî ‚Äî ‚Äî ‚Äî ‚Äî ‚Äî ‚Äî ‚Äî ‚Äî ‚Äî ‚Äî ‚Äî\nTrainee: ‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà ¬†aka ‚ÄúSteroid‚Äù\nDate of Birth: [REDACTED]\nPersonal Trainer: Specialist Alex ‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà\nReport Date: [REDACTED]\nIntroduction:\nThis report outlines the training progression of ‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà , also referred to as ‚ÄúSteroid‚Äù, starting from his personal sessions on the super destroyer of Alpha Recon 6, to his current status.

It‚Äôs always apple juice.‚Äù  -CC-07 ‚ÄúCrumbs‚Äù\nDuties:\nThe bold leader of the Crumbs Company, being a stalwart for the frontlines in both fronts. Leading his many platoons of battle-hardened helldivers to victory. He is the battle-ram of the ‚ÄúHell‚Äù Battalion, straightforward, logistical, and intellectually gifted at wartime strategies. He is a formidable foe for any adversary.¬†\nOperational Conduct:\nCrumbs is quite the self-sufficient person when it comes to his strategies. Using the Jump Pack as well as the Flame Thrower to employ hit and run tactics on the bugs. He uses the Orbital Rail Cannon Strike as an anti-tank option and a machine gun sentry for horde clearance and a way to use it as a decoy to make a hasty escape.¬†\nMilitary Career:\nBefore Crumbs was enlisted, he was a inhabitant of the most infamous planet of the Umlaut Sector, Meridia. Spending his early childhood in a E-710 farm, with both of his loving parents XXXXXXX and XXXXXXX. Being exposed to the terminids early on led to his expertise with the species. His life was relatively peaceful, though Around the age of XX ¬†his parents started to have marriage issues, and ultimately ended up with him as an orphan. Without parents Crumbs did fine, making a best friend named XXXXXXX. In the orphanage he got exposed to lots of posters about the Helldivers corps, making him resilient to trauma. Once the terminids started to escape enclosure and attack the civilians, he and several other people got evacuated to high-priority citizen bunkers, but not at a loss. As he was evacuating, his best friend got slaughtered as a bane of terminid ‚ÄúWarriors‚Äù lunged at him and got torn into shreds. With the blood of his friend on him he managed to make it into the bunker. As he grew up, his hatred for terminids ended up with him being enlisted to the Helldiver corps. During that time, he helped the construction of the TCS towers to repel the terminid advance. As he fell from his hellpod, he saw the familiar place he once lived, as well as the skeleton of his old friend, still wearing the Super-Earth issued uniform, just with a plethora of cuts from the warrior. A piece of fabric pinned to his armor symbolizes his best friend, and uses it as a reminder to push on. He climbed the ranks quickly, being able to lead a squad into the terminid supercolony that is meridia and launched several attacks to deploy the dark fluid into the planet. Every time, gathering trophies of the bugs, ranging from a head of a hunter, a wing of a shrieker, or even a piece of armor from a fallen bile titan. As the planet reached its limit, He witnessed the planet implode on itself, just before FTL jumping, creating the wormhole that we know today. Multiple privates have noted that he would spend long periods of time, staring into the remnants of merida, while holding a small blue piece of fabric, saying ‚ÄúI did it XXXXXXX, I did it for you‚Äù.\nRecruitment to the 101st ‚ÄúHell‚Äù Battalion:\nShortly after his operations on Angels Venture. Crumbs kept on losing squad after squad on Malevelon Creek and eventually running out of reinforcements, Crumbs decides to go solo, changing the pace for the mission throughout.By being solo, the automaton forces had a difficult time tracking his position, him often using single-hit stratagems to make his presence less bold. By using several stealth tactics and utilizing sentries as decoys, he was able to complete many objectives for the ICBM as stealthily as possible. The only time Crumbs had to stand his ground was during the long processes that involved raising the ICBM and fueling it with XXXXXXXX. This mission overall caused Crumbs to lose faith in the standard issue helldivers. This caught the attention of the person with the callsign ‚ÄúSteroid‚Äù promising ‚ÄúGreater opportunities‚Äù and ‚Äúspecialized divers‚Äù.¬†\nTrauma and PTSD:\nAs mentioned before, Crumbs has a rare case of not appearing to have any forms of stress-disorders or any trauma. Super-Earth Doctors have examined his brain through multiple different scans. And have noticed severely less brain activity in the part where a person feels sorrow or regret, the activity being more active in parts where feelings of retribution, redemption, revenge, and vengeance. Scientists suggest the early exposure to the element E-710 may have caused his younger self‚Äôs developing brain to develop differently causing his interesting condition. Scientists trying to cure his condition realized how great this could be for all Helldivers, creating a batch of highly experimental E-710 pills for a group of select children of varying intelligence. Experiment:XXXXXXXXX was tough to carry out and the results were quite varied. No matter the intelligence of children, the effect of the pills didn‚Äôt seem to do much. Kids either get full on brain damage, hyper focus, full-body paralysis, or receive no pain. This experiment was an overall XXXXXX and this subject needs to be further researched upon.\nService in the 101st:\nAfter enlisting through Steroids affirmation. He was a private\nunder Steroids rule. Crumbs spent most of his free time doing XXXXXXX and XXXXXXX. Though he didn‚Äôt know it, most of his sargents kept a keen eye on him. Quite quickly, Crumbs went from private to corporal very quickly. As he showed his sharp skills on the field, ordering privates around though he was still a private. Being a new corporal. He started to create a slew of deployments, attacking the automaton frontline and repelling the bugs. Multiple cases from privates (Who are sadly not with us anymore) tell us how his leadership skills were like no other. Delivering orders like no other, while still watching out for his team. One private said ‚ÄúDude! Crumbs is crazy, like he took one glance at the map and identified a stalker lair right after we dropped down!‚Äù Unfortunately, PVT-XXXXXXXX died in a stalker encounter after the aforementioned deployment. Through a series of major orders and mass deployments, Crumbs climbed the ranks quickly leading to who he is today."},"Personnel-Files/Personnel-File-CC-08-Gael":{"title":"Personnel File CC-08 Gael","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"\n101st ‚ÄúHell‚Äù Battalion\nMilitary Personnel File\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCodename: CPT-08 ‚ÄúGael‚ÄùName: ¬†‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñàRank: CaptainDOB: ‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ÄúAd Victoriam Pro Terra Aeterna‚Äù    ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†-CC-08 ‚ÄúGael‚Äù\nDuties:\nCaptain of the Eurasian Company, he is a tough, but strong leader. Leading his many platoons to victory no matter the adversary, from the scorching temperatures of Hellmire, dense jungles of Malevelon creek, to the freezing temperatures of Marfark. He uses real-life tactics to strategize in tough situations, saving the lives of many, divers or civilians apart.\nOperational Conduct:\nGael is quite the team player when it comes to his fighting style, Most of the time running the team‚Äôs designated Anti-Tank class. Using his trusty Recoilless rifle paired with many eagle strikes and orbitals. Due to his ‚Äúhigh impact‚Äù playstyle, he prefers using heavy armor, starring the Kodiak and Winter Warrior Armors as his main gear.¬†\nMilitary Career:\n¬†At the start, Gael was born into a loving and caring family on Super Earth. His Mother and Father named ‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà¬†and ‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà w¬†with two younger siblings, ‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà¬†and ‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà. Him being the oldest, he was destined to be the one who watched over the kids. His father, a high-ranking official of ‚ÄúMorgunson‚Äù Used his high clearance level to access weaponry that many civilians can not access. This gave the ability of Gael‚Äôs dad to provide firearms that most of the Helldiver Corps used frequently. Often bringing young gael to private shooting ranges stationed at where he worked, having one-to-one sessions teaching how to shoot. Of course, a kid with such expertise was out of the ordinary, he was enlisted as a sergeant in the SEAF and was stationed on many E-710 farms. Being able to eradicate dissidents so well he caught the attention of many, leading his quick enlistment to the Helldiver Corps. Gael was quite the unit, quickly stomping down and wiping our dissident cells for about 3 years. Once the terminid scourge started to become a major threat, he was recalled from his haven and put to the frontlines to deal with bug infestations. Gael as a Helldiver proved no issue for him, charging at the frontlines many bug planets, including the frigid planet of Estanu and and the smokey deserts of Erata Prime. He didn‚Äôt go unnoticed, gaining many medals for his actions and leadership. Several privates have seen him ‚Äútear a bug in half while it was alive‚Äù by using the snowshoes on his armor to stomp hunters and scavengers.\n¬†\n¬†\n¬†\n\nRecruitment to the 101st ‚ÄúHell‚Äù Battalion:\nAfter his many deployments, he eventually caught the attention of BM-01 ‚ÄúMind‚Äù. Who at that time, was starting to develop the early roots of the 101st. Given his skills, Gael was quickly pulled into the battalion. Mind saw Gael fight the automaton menace aboard his Super Destroyer, using his eagle-eye to closely monitor the actions and decisions Gael takes. The automatons which wiped out many civilian settlements did not seem to have any mental toll on Gael, him simply being there to finish a job, which Mind liked a lot about him. Gael had a ‚Äúno-bullshit‚Äù attitude dealing with the main objective, and some sides before leaving. Though Gael liked to work with the Helldiver corps, he never grew any real attachment to the group, and gladly joined the 101st when Mind approached him after they extracted.\nTrauma and PTSD:\nGael has an interesting case for his trauma. Since he was the one who protected his younger siblings in school, he grew up in violence. His younger siblings would be frequently bullied, mostly due to their heritage. And often having young Gael knock them out on the sidewalk. His early exposure to violence and his early exposure to firearms from his father molded him into the captain he is today. His time fighting also contributed to his desensitization of trauma and PTSD. Frequent losses of poor divers and shellshock led him to simply not have any real feelings toward any morally debilitating losses on the battleground. Instead of grieving the loss of a subordinate, he would change that sorrow into anger, often being seen shooting the bodies of the automatons or ripping the terminid that killed a diver.\nService in the 101st:\nGael moved up the ranks with Steroid as well, being under command of Freeze and Mind. Gael worked quite well with Steroid, both having relatively similar interests and hatred, but still having wildly different experience working for the SEAF¬†and early childhoods. They would spend most of their time going into deployments together as well as goofing around in the mess hall. His skills were unmatched in different ways, preferring to stick with the fireteam and not going solo like others. Having zero issue with ordering his subordinates around. Pushing the automaton front, and being able to use his sharp senses to hear and see patrols from extreme distances. From the thumps from hulks or the steady humms¬†from a tank. He would be able to identify a threat when they are not even remotely near histeam. Many privates under his command have seen him look at the track of a bot patrol and accurately described each footprint, from the spacing and pattern of the track he was able to determine that there were 3 troopers, 4 devastators, 3 berserkers and 1 hulk. He has also been noted to blast off the face of a bile titan, just under 10 meters away from him, spraying the surrounding area and him with green goop from the blast of his trusty Recoilless Rifle. Gael quickly climbed the ranks, due to the massive vacancy currently available during the start of the battalion, he was raised from private to corporal quickly. Getting trained from Freeze and Mind, he rose to sergeant and quickly to the Captain. After being inactive for a bit, he was quickly put back into service and to this day, still the bold leader of the Gael/Eurasian Company.\n"},"Resources/Acronyms-Abbreviations-Slang":{"title":"Acronyms Abbreviations Slang","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Communication and Abbreviations\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbbreviationMeaningSeenCopy, Understood, YesCOCommanding OfficerJCOJunior Commanding OfficerSCOSenior Commanding OfficerHQHeadquartersHCHigh CommandICIn Command2ICSecond in Command\nAcronyms\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFireteam LeaderLeads Part of the Squad while in a Deployment; not Deployment Leader\nRanks\nEnlisted:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCDTCadetPVTPrivateSPCSpecialist\n\nJunior Commanding Officers:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCPLCorporalSGTSergeantSMSergeant Major\n\nSenior Commanding Officers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSLSecond LieutenantLTLieutenant\n\nCommanders\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCCCompany CaptainCMMajorBCBattalion Commander\n\nReinforcements\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNMCNull Mech TrooperMTMech Trooper\n"},"Resources/Chain-of-Command/Command-Structure":{"title":"Command Structure","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBattalionThe whole of the 101st, led¬†by Battalion Commander Mind, with Majors providing support.

and congratulations on your soon to be Promotions! This will be a short course or Reminder on how to create and manage Departure Notices. If you have any Questions after this please feel free to message your Commanding Officer and if they are not reachable the Person above them.\nI‚Äôm going to be splitting this Guide¬† into 3 different Segments:\nSignup Creation\n\nCreation\nTheming¬†¬†\n\nSignup Editing\n\nChanges\nInforming People of Changes\n¬†- Rules for Changes\n\nSignup Removal\n\nReasons for Removal\nProcedure for Removal\nInforming People of Removal\n\nSignup Creation:\nCreation:\nFirst of head into the ‚ÄúDeployment-Signup‚Äù Channel within the Discord, this is where you will be posting your Signups. After doing so go to the Message Bar and write¬†\n‚Äú/Event Create‚Äù and click on the event create Option. Afterwards you should see this:\n\nEvent Creations are split up into 3 parts:¬† the title, the event start and the Description.\nThe title can be anything you want to call it for Example you could just type Operation:‚Äúname‚Äù in it but this is solely up to you.\n\nAfterwards you set the Time of the Deployment. You will type in the ‚Äúevent_start‚Äù Option in¬† this format: year-month-day time an example would be this:\n\nBe advised: The time has to be written in the 24 Hour Clock in UTC+2.\nYou will have to adjust this in order to set correct times for your Deployments.\nIf for example you are one hour ahead in UTC+3 and it is 24:00 for you and the next day has started. You would have to set the date a day back since it is only 23:00 and the day before in UTC+2\nLast but not least you can add a Description by clicking in the Chat Bar outside of any of the already given templates. There you see Options of what you can do but the only important one is the ‚ÄúDescription‚Äù option. Click this again and you will add a field for your Description. In this you can type anything you want to do in your Deployment.\nFor example, if you wish to host a Deployment on the Automaton front on Difficulty 9 with only Barrages you could type it up like this:\nAfter you have done all of the Above your deployment Signup should look something like this:\n\nor like this\n\nOnce you have done all of these Steps you can just hit enter and the Bot will automatically create your Signup and all you have left to do is be sure to Join your own Deployment.\nTheming:\nThe theme of the Deployment is completely left up to you, all you have to do is to make sure to write anything specific you want to do within the Description in order for everyone who signs up to know what will be happening in this Mission.\nSignup Editing:\nChanges:\nIf you need to change anything within your existing Deployment just go into the Chat bar again and type in ‚Äúevent edit‚Äù, click on the Option which will prompt a window that should look like this:\n\nHere you have 3 fields that need to be filled out. First is the event id. If you click on it it should display all currently ongoing deployments. If you wish to find your deployment then you just need to click on the Deployment that has your name in it. After this is done you can click on the certain ‚ÄúField‚Äù you want to change, for example if i wish to change the time of the deployment due to me being unable to host at the given time i can click on the ‚Äúevent start‚Äù Option, which will then prompt me to assign a new value to the event start time.\nYou will have to Type in the entire time again in the format given on the previous page. Let‚Äôs say i want to change the time from 15:00 to 16:00 I‚Äôd have to type it like this:\n\nThe same goes for the Description and title. If you want to add something to your description then you need to copy the existing Description and add anything in it.\nAfter you have done this you can just hit enter and the Bot will automatically change anything you wanted to change.\nInforming people of Changes:\nOnce you have changed either the time or Description of the Signup after people have already joined the Deployment just inform them in the Hub or in Dms with a small message that pings them and states what you changed, for example like this:\n\nRules for Changes:\nIf you are planning on changing either the time or adding more Conditions to the Deployment Description then you will be required to inform already existing members in the Deployment signup, that is either within the main Deployment or the Backup of said changes. If you fail to do so and a person does not wish or can not attend the Deployment any longer then it is on you and the person who does not attend is not at fault and will not be held accountable.\nSignup Removal:\nReasons for Removal:\nThere are 2 Main Reasons for Deployment removal:\n\nThe Deployment has ended and the Signup is just taking up Space.\nWhenever you finish a Deployment you are asked to remove your own Deployment Signup in¬†order to not cluster the chat with already finished Deployments.\nYou will not be able to host the Deployment and need to cancel it.\nIf you are ever unable to host the Deployment due to whatever reason please remove it in order to not confuse people with a non-existent Deployment.\n\nProcedure of Removal:\nIf you wish to remove your Signup you again go into the chat bar and type in ‚Äúevent removal‚Äù\nBe sure that it is removal and not ‚Äúevent close‚Äù ,these two options do different things.\nOnce you have done so you again just choose your event Id and click on it from the list given above the chat. Once you have chosen your Signup you just hit enter and the Bot automatically removes your signup. BE WARNED you are able to remove other people‚Äôs signups so make sure you only select your own to not cause confusion about missing signups. If you get caught doing this you will be punished.\nInforming People of Removal:\nIf you have removed the Deployment signup for reason 2. You will need to inform anyone signed up as either Main Squad or Backup of the removal.\nAgain you will do this in the hub¬†or Dms using a small message that states which deployment it is and give the reason (as long as it isn‚Äôt too personal) of why you did so, for example like this:\n\nAfter you have done this you fulfilled your role in informing anyone involved of the cancellation of the Deployment and can go about your day.\nCongratulations Helldivers now you know how to manage your Deployment Signups!\nIf you have any other Questions feel free to message your CO‚Äôs with these Questions.\nI hope you all have a Wonderful day.

This is Loadouts explained. This document will show you what types of weapons there are and in Part 2 will show you how to make a proper loadout. As you may know, weapons can fit into different types at the same time.\nTypes: There are several types of weapons a Diver would bring for a loudout.\n\nGeneralist [GL]\nSingle-Target [ST]\nMobbing [MB]\nCrowd-Control [CC]\n\nGeneralist\nGL weapons are able to fill out each role to some extent. Good Single Target and Mobbing DMG or DPS, paired with some Stagger and Push. Examples would be the SG-225IE Breaker Incendiary and the SG-8P Punisher Plasma, Terminid and Automaton GL type weapon respectively. Each has CC capabilites, Incendiary and high Stagger, alongside mobbing groups of enemies and smashing single targets. Having these types of weapons can make a mission a lot better, as they fill out plenty of roles.\nSingle-Target\nST weapons are able to kill a singular enemy at a time. To make up for the lack of mobbing, these weapons are paired with high Stagger or Push and have a fast TTK. Examples would be the JAR-5 Dominator or the SG-8 Punisher, both have amazing ST DMG and good CC capabilities. These weapons can help aid a team when there isn‚Äôt enough fast ways to kill enemies.\nMobbing\nMB weapons as stated in the name, are able to kill several or a dozen enemies faster than a Single-Target enemy could. These weapons usually have something aiding them to kill, Incendiary, high DPS, etc. Examples could be AR-23A Liberator Carbine, with its high DPS and fast RPM, it can take out several bugs in a couple of seconds. These weapons will aid in a team when there are too many enemies to take out, so bring one with you.\nCrowd-Control\nCC weapons are found with different categories, these weapon are able to Stagger, Push, and Flinch enemies EFFECTIVELY, unlike the Slugger‚Ä¶ Weapons with strong CC capabilties would be the SG-8 Punisher, able to push enemies back effectively.\n\nCredit\nWritten by Head of Compendium SGT Styanax\n"},"The-Compendium/How-To-Helldive/HtH-2-Loadout-Creation":{"title":"HtH 2 Loadout Creation","links":["The-Compendium/How-To-Helldive/HtH-1-Loadouts-Types"],"tags":["Compendium","HTH"],"content":"DISCLAIMER: PLEASE READ\nHtH 1 Loadouts Types\nBEFORE READING THIS DOCUMENT\nHello Divers! This is Loadouts, explained. This document will show you how you can use the several types of weaponry within our arsenal to make a Jack-of-all-Trades loadout or a specialised one!\nLoadout Creation - Basics\nDepending on which enemies you‚Äôre facing, each type of weapon may be prioritised over others. When making a Generalist loadout, you may want to use Generalist stratagems and weapons, the PLAS-1 Scorcher and the AC-8 Autocannon can be paired as generalists. If you want to run a weapon that is Single-Target, you may want to bring a weapon that leans more to the mobbing side, vice versa. When fighting bugs, Generalists like the SG-225IE and the ARC-12 are strong options as well as Mobbing weapons are decently strong. Single-Target weapons are not as need but can still be strong options. When fighting bots, Generalists like the SG-8P and PLAS-1 are strong options. However, unlike Terminids, Single-Target weapons are a decent margin better than Mobbing weapons. However, if you‚Äôd like a specialised build, spending your Primaries, Secondaries, Supports, and 1 or 2 Stratagems helping with that specific loadout type, will be a good option, however, spending all of your stratagems on 1 type may lead to holes within your loadout, causing you to be unable to kill specific enemies fast.\nHow to Pair Weapons\nMany weapons can have synergy, having weapons that match together because they fill out each other‚Äôs weaknesses is a good way to find how to pair a weapon. The SG-8 Punisher is good at Stagger and Single-Target killing but is unable to kill each enemy fast enough to fight a horde quickly, pairing it with a mobbing weapon like the GL-21 Grenade Launcher would be extremely helpful it, covering its mobbing weakness.\n\nCredit\nWritten by Head of Compendium SGT Styanax\n"},"The-Compendium/How-To-Helldive/HtH-3-Loadout-Synergy":{"title":"HtH 3 Loadout Synergy","links":["The-Compendium/How-To-Helldive/HtH-1-Loadouts-Types","The-Compendium/How-To-Helldive/HtH-2-Loadout-Creation"],"tags":["Compendium","HTH"],"content":"DISCLAIMER: PLEASE READ\nHtH 1 Loadouts Types &amp; HtH 2 Loadout Creation\nBEFORE READING THIS DOCUMENT\nHello Divers! This is Loadouts, explained. This document will show you how a mediocre Stratagem can become an extremely good Stratagem when paired with the right Loadout! _\nBasic Synergy\nMany weapons usually fill out one role within the Loadout, with other Stratagems filling out the other roles that the weapon itself cannnot fill out. However, many Stratagems can be paired with other weapons to unlock more playstyles and help that specific weapon with its weakness.\nHow to Synergise a Loadout\nAll weapons have set Armour Penetration levels, being scaled on 0 - 10. Weapons such as the Grenade Launcher have an AP level of 3 / 10, giving it Type 1 Medium Armour Penetration, this means it cannot penetrate Bile Titan Armour at a level of 5 / 10 on the body, and 6 / 10 on the leg. This weapon is extremely good at mobbing but it unable to take out Heavy Targets. To make up for this downside a Diver could use a 500 KG, or make a synergy within the Loadout by using the Eagle 110 mm Rocket Pods. When used correctly the Eagle 110 can knock off the side Armour of the Bile Titan, which allows for the Grenade Launcher to shoot around the area, killing the Titan in around 2 - 4 Shots, however it can still be more depending on how the Rocket Pods land.\nYou need to consider all pros on cons of a specific Stratagem, and pair it up with another Stratagem that can help fill out a small gap within the area you need filling out, as well as filling out another area. An example would be the GL-21 Grenade Launcher given in the prior paragraph - The Grenade Launcher can damage Bile Titans but only the Bile Sack, however when using the Rocket Pods correctly, the Grenade Launcher can directly damage the Bile Titan.
